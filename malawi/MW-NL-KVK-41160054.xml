    <title>Framework for dialogue</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: For religious leaders and people living with HIV networks</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The proposed project is to implement a systematic and guided evidence-based dialogue between religious leaders and people living with HIV networks in Malawi and Ethiopia to ensure that faith institutions policies and messages are grounded on real experiences, human rights and gender equality.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The project objective is to ensure, through dialogue and use of evidence, that country-level responses of faith communities and religious leaders meet the needs of people living with HIV.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: Direct target group: Religious leaders and people living with HIV in the two focus countries (Malawi and Ethiopia). 
Indirect target group: The wider community.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Both in Malawi and Ethiopia there is a high prevalence of HIV among the population. The people living with HIV face the consequences of being banned from religious or other activities. The largest part of Malawi and Ethiopia are Christian, a part is Muslim and there are also some smaller religious groups.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: Our advocacy includes raising awareness and building a movement for justice within the churches as well as mobilizing people of faith to lobby local and national governments, businesses, and multi-lateral organizations. We partner with many organizations who share common goals on these critical issues, believing that the more we work together, the stronger our voice is for justice.

The two countries were chosen because of the following:

- The people living with HIV Stigma Index evidence is available and can form the basis of the dialogue.
- Religion plays a major role in people’s lives, with religious leaders holding a gate-keeper role in all aspects of communities.
- Generalized HIV epidemics.
- There is a strong network of religious leaders living with HIV.
- There is an inter-faith dialogue established already.
- Counter parts of the Ecumenical Advocacy Alliance (EAA), ICCO the dutch cofounding organization and Cordaid are implementing programs which focus on topics such as Sexual Reproductive Health Rights, HIV and faith.
- A significant number of religious leaders have signed the Personal Commitment declaration.
- People living with HIV network is existing and operational (and also implemented the people living with HIV Stigma
Index and the Stop Aids Now! Greater Involvement People Living with Aids Community tool).
</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The EAA is an international network of churches and church-related organizations committed to campaigning together on common concerns. Current campaigns focus on HIV and AIDS and Food. Our advocacy includes raising awareness and building a movement for justice within the churches as well as mobilizing people of faith to lobby local and national governments, businesses, and multi-lateral organizations. We partner with many organizations who share common goals on these critical issues, believing that the more we work together, the stronger our voice is for justice.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: This is an ongoing process started in 2009 were Cordaid engages in working with different religious leaders from different religions to break remaining taboos around aids and related sexual issues.  </description>

    <title>Workshops for youth in prison</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Workshops in Kachere and Mbyanzi prison.</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Youth in Malawi often end up in prison due to poor circumstances and little crimes. After release they often fall back into the life they are used to. Therefore Cordaid, in collaboration with the Dutch Foundation Youth in Prison, wants to provide workshops for these youth in prison,  which enables them to work on their personal development, and provide a reintegration program after release.
</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: In cooperation with the Foundation Young in Prison, we aim to support the local organization Music Crossroads Malawi in providing workshops to unprivileged youth in prison to give them hope for a better future.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The direct target group is the local organization Music Crossroads Malawi. The final beneficiaries are underprivileged youth in prison.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: The organization Young in Prison uses several strategies to help underprivileged youth in prison. Through providing this youth with workshops, this will enable them to develop themselves and their skills. Youth in Prison also aims to strengthen local organizations in providing support to unprivileged youth. Finally, Youth in Prison fights for the future of this youth through advocacy and lobby to raise awareness concerning this issue among the communities and authorities.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The main activities of the project are:

- Kachere Reformatory Centre
Several workshops will be organized. For example, choir workshop, traditional and modern dance workshop and health education workshops will be given.

- Mbyanzi juvenile prison
Several workshops will be organized. For example, art workshop, tailoring and health education workshops will be given.

- Intensive mentoring and post-release project
15 boys, who are close to their release date, will be selected to receive intensive mentoring. 10 Boys will be selected for the post-release project. They will have bi-annual meetings to brainstorm on how to improve the situation of youth in prison. They will also go to prisons to share their stories and to inspire other youth to start working on a better future.

- Post-release workshops for all ex-convicts
Several workshops will be organized: career guidance, life skills workshop, leadership workshop and artist workshop.

- Strengthening the basis, lobby and advocacy 
Several events will be organized. For example, an art show, prison tour and radio show live from prison will be organized.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: By providing support to the local organization Music Crossroads Malawi, we aim to strengthen its capacity and make it a sustainable organization. At the moment Music Crossroads Malawi receives funding, but within the coming years it should raise funds and find support from local initiatives. </description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: Cordaid and the Foundation Youth in Prison have been working together since 2007. In 2007 Cordaid supported a program in Surinam. Since 2011 Cordaid supports this project in Malawi.</description>

    <title>Improving SRH for Rural Adolesents</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Access to S&amp;RH care for rural adolescents in Rumphi, Mzimba North &amp; Chitipa</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The program intends to increase access to youth-friendly Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) services; access to family planning methods and quality reproductive health care as well as promote empowerment of the community to make the health system  more responsive to Adolescent Sexual Reproductive Health. </description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: To contribute to the improvement of sexual and reproductive health of Malawi’s youth in the context of gender equity, sexual and reproductive rights and improvement of maternal health as outlined by MDG 5.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The direct beneficiaries are 12.000 young people, in and out of school, in the age of 12 to 24 years with low educational levels, inadequate knowledge regarding SRH issues and limited access to SRH services. Other direct beneficiaries are the parents and key members of the communities. The project will also work with health staff, school, village and health committees who will benefit from the training efforts and increase their capacity to attend to young people.

</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Teenage pregnancy is a major health concern because of its association with higher morbidity and mortality for both mother and the child (Demographic Health Survey (DHS) 2010). Teenage pregnancy is also one of the contributing factors to high dropout rates for girls; 13% cite pregnancy as the primary reason for leaving school.  Knowledge of at least one contraceptive method is very high among adolescents with 82% of females and 90% of males knowing at least one method. However, use of contraceptive modern method is lower with 50% of females and 43% males having ever used a modern method. Despite high levels of knowledge of family planning, more than two-thirds of adolescents who are sexually active are not practicing contraception, which highlights the need to intensify efforts to address low levels of contraceptive use.   Misconceptions are still there: eg. 40 % of females and 45% of males held the misconception that a girl could not get pregnant the first time. </description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: Specific Objectives and Activities
1. To promote participation, social mobilization and empowerment of the community to achieve comprehensive sustainable changes and solutions and make the health system more responsive to the SRH problems young people face. 
There will be a communication and education campaign directed towards the community (parents, young people, community leaders, teachers) targeting those actors who have the potential to influence community norms, behavior, and socio-cultural factors that affect the SRH of young people. The campaign will emphasize the acquisition of skills by the community which are necessary to develop critical thinking, to promote community dialogue and collective action in social-change processes; community capacity as an organizing construct for community-involvement interventions; and initiate social action to obtain changes within the community to create an enabling environment that influences choices available to youths and related decision-making on SRH. 

2. To provide comprehensive information, sex education based on the development of skills, abilities and positive life values regarding family planning methods and seeking health care. 
To develop a comprehensive sexuality education; iterative learning methods, discussion and reflection will be used, instead of the paradigm of teaching and imposing knowledge and norms. This will promote a different form of learning whereby young people develop their own values and attitudes, learning from each other and involving their communities. The activities will provide young people a framework which will facilitate them to learn about their sexual and reproductive rights; acquire information to dispel myths; gender issues; provide references to resources and services in health and education; obtain skills in communication, negotiation, self development, decision-making; and develop a sense of self, confidence, assertiveness, capacity to take responsibility, ability to ask questions, seek help and a sense of responsibility. 

3. To contribute towards improved quantity or quality of reproductive health services and youth friendliness of SRH services for young people in the pre-pregnancy phase through the Coupon system.
The project will establish appropriate confidential youth-friendly SRH health services and make these services more accessible, especially to youth who need them most. This will be done through the development of a competitive SRH Coupon program, which will furthermore strengthen the capacity of staff of service providers (public, private-non-profit or private-for-profit) in providing quality, appropriate and timely care. The scheme has the potential to target specific segments of the population effectively and provide them with priority services such as family planning.
The project will also provide training of health staff of participating providers to raise awareness about the SRH needs of young people and improve their knowledge and technical and communication skills to prepare health staff to provide quality, youth-friendly, confidential, accessible SRH services consistent with the needs of young people.

</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: Developing a community’s capacity to solve problems related to ASRH requires action at the individual, institutional and social level. While communities may not have much experience addressing ASRH-related issues prior to an external organizations’ involvement, communities can develop ASRH capacity over time. It is just as important to assess a community’s capacity to address ASRH and other health issues, as it is to survey adolescent knowledge, attitudes and practices, and to document the availability of youth services. 

DAMRA believes that a capable community that supports an enabling environment for youth will foster both individual and institutional change. The proposed project will therefore dedicate much of its activities to equipping the beneficiaries with skills that will enable them to share sexual reproductive health and rights messages with fellow citizens in communities other than the core project impact areas. The knowledge imparted to the local communities through the project will make them appreciate maternal health issues and participate in demanding quality reproductive health service delivery. Community trainings by the project will also focus on strengthening the management capacities of the community so that they can collectively manage the operations of the project without any outside support.

DAMRA will closely work with the District Health Office (DHO) through Community Health surveillance Assistants (HSA) who will be trained together with health personnel in youth friendly health services provision but they will be incorporated in the project activities as patrons and advisers for all the established SRH youth clubs. The HSA’s in collaboration with the youth club leaders will coordinate the activities of the youths in the SRH clubs. This relationship we believe will provide the necessary link between community youths and the local health facilities where the youths will be getting the Youth friendly health services. The relationship will thus instill confidence in the youths to access reproductive health care and ensure sustainability of the project activities. 
The youths in all project established clubs, led by the community peer educators, will be trained and empowered to organize and carry out outreach activities by themselves. This will ensure practical experience in organization and management of SRH activities after the project funding ends. A minimum budget has been allocated for such events to support the youth clubs during the project period as they learn how to conduct the SRH outreach activities. 
</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: Damra has been operating in some of the most marginalized areas in Malawi since 2008, but they are currently focusing on Rumphi and adjacent districts of northern Malawi.  A program focusing on SRHR has not yet been carried out.  </description>

    <title>Protect and Respect</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: A Sexual and Reproductive Health Project focused on adolescents</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Protect and Respect is a Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) project that focuses on youth. This project intends to improve knowledge of adolescents on SRH through mass media (mainly radio programs) and also encourage the youths to access services at hospitals and health centers. The project has been implemented in four sites in the two districts as pilot sites.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: We aim to empower youth and adolescents to take control of their own sexual and reproductive health rights. </description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The primary target group for this program is sexually active adolescent youth with access to radio in Malawi. This group is often at risk of HIV/AIDS, STI and unplanned pregnancies. The secondary target groups are SRH Service Providers and Community SRH Volunteers, who aim to increase their knowledge and raise awareness of adolescent SRH rights and people living with HIV/AIDS.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Malawi has a population of approximately 12.3 million, with more than a fifth of the population being between 10–19 years. Many adolescents adopt risky behaviors without having adequate or correct information on how to protect themselves and the consequences of these behaviors. Girls and young women face a dual threat of unplanned pregnancy and risk of HIV, which often are exacerbated by poverty and low literacy levels. 
However the bright side is that approximately 75 - 80% of the young population remains uninfected. In order to curtail the further spread of the HIV virus and aspire for ‘an HIV Free’ generation, there is need for concerted efforts and strategies to effectively communicate appropriate HIV/AIDS messages and skills that not only educate the youth, particularly girls and young women, but also empower them to make and act on informed decisions about their lives and future.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: 1.	The Protect and Respect Radio Show
Young people will be invited to share with Story Workshop their worries, problems, opinions, and ideas on issues related to sex and relationship by phone message texting (sms), phone or letters. The radio talk show will be made as interactive and lively as possible. On the radio the issue to be discussed next week will be announced. Young people from all over Malawi who would like to be involved in the discussion can contact Story Workshop (by sms). A production team will follow up on these reactions and invite 6 young people to the show. Their contribution will be based on real life stories. There will be an emphasis on young people in urban areas because they are highly neglected in other programs and they are at risk in different ways. 
In the middle of the one hour radio show, there will be a life component where a “Mister Condom” is life present at a place where young people come (youth center, bar, video room, can be anywhere). Mister Condom carries out a few short interviews on the same issues discussed in the studio and asks whether any of the young people around do have a condom with them. Anybody who can produce a condom on the spot gets a T-shirt. There is going to be a strong message that it is responsible and ‘cool’ to have condoms with you.

2.	Safe Motherhood campaigns 
Story Workshop follows a demand driven approach. In the radio show, communities will be asked to invite SWET if they want Safe Motherhood campaign in their community. The invitation can come from youth or women groups, health surveillance assistance or even from district offices. 
SWET will first conduct a baseline to research on the prevailing issues and factors affecting SRH and safe motherhood in the community. Based on the findings SWET will identify and train local drama groups within the targeted communities to disseminate messages and engage communities in dialogue about issues related to safe motherhood, male involvement in maternal health access and quality of SRH, harmful cultural practices, HIV/AIDS prevention including Preventing Mother To Child Transmission among others.  The aim will be to change and confront existing community norms related to sexuality and gender and improve the response to the needs of adolescents and young people.
At the end of the week, a safe motherhood day will be carried out with: 
-	A family planning information market (organized in cooperation with the appropriate service provider).
-	A performance on Safe Motherhood.
At the end of the performance and the discussion the community will take a pledge which will be posted somewhere central in the village: NO WOMAN WILL DIE FROM PREGNANCY OR CHILDBIRTH IN THIS COMMUNITY.
-	A Safe Motherhood campaign group (radio listening group) will be established. 
The Safe Motherhood Campaign group will develop a work plan with different activities such as: 
-	Visits to pregnant women to alert them to the radio program and to check upon their care status. 
-	Making family planning means available in the community on a regular base
-	Develop activities towards the health system to improve the quality of care. 
-	Organizing discussions among pregnant women and their partners after listening to the radio programs. 
-	Investigate each and every case of maternal mortality in the village and conduct discussions on how to avoid these cases in the future.
Story Workshop will be able to support 20 campaigns over the period of 2 years but hopes to start a movement that will need further support. In year two Story Workshop will organize a National Safe Motherhood/Family Planning Debate: a 5 hour live radio show with policy makers and care givers in the studio, live and recorded contributions from the campaigning groups, pregnant women etc.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: It is envisaged that the project interventions will be sustained at community level for the following reasons:
- The involvement of government service providers throughout project implementations will help to ensure that the communities are supported and that there is continued follow up even beyond the project period. 
- The project will advocate for the provision of Youth Friendly Health Services which will mean that where necessary service providers will have to change their system and attitude when dealing with the youth. This will yield long term results as young people will be able to access the services in a free and safe manner.
- Involvement of partners in project implementation will help to ensure that youth have access to services. SWET will facilitate the mobilization and establishment of structures of other organizations which can continue to provide services to the communities after the project.
- Community leaders, who are the custodians of culture, will be involved throughout the project. This will help to reinforce the transformation process since the leaders will be in the fore front to change things in their communities. 
- The project will create or support community structures like youth and women’s clubs, traditional initiators and traditional and religious marriage counselors, among others. In addition the project will also work with Village Health Committees as well as train Community SRH Volunteers. The knowledge and capacity of these groups will be built such that they will serve as resource persons in their respective communities, serving all youths and not only those directly targeted by the project. 
- The community and individual changes that will be influenced by the project will have both short term and long term benefits. In the long term youth in the targeted communities will be able to live healthier and more productive lives, will young girls will be encouraged to stay in school and not rush into marriage and therefore contribute significantly to the development of their communities and the society. </description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: Cordaid supports SWET since 1999. And since 2007 we helped to set up media campaigns, such as the media campaign 'Violence against Women', the Timasukirane national HIV/AIDS radio show and the campaign for acknowledgement of home based care workers that resulted in the short movie “Who cares…”.</description>

    <title>Malawi Emergency and Early Recovery</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Helping vulnerable families to fight food insecurity </description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Environmental degradation and rise of food prices have been increasingly compromising the capacity of smallholder farmers to meet their basic nutritional needs. The program Malawi Emergency and Early Recovery Response enables vulnerable households to improve their food security, increase their resilience and to strength their capacity to respond to food shortage through mitigation measures.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The overall objective of the project is to contribute to the alleviation of hunger and food insecurity among vulnerable households. The program involves the direct food distribution and food for work programs. This is complemented with recovery promotion interventions such as seed distribution and technical support on disaster risk reduction.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The program targets vulnerable communities that have been severely affected by food insecurity and have never been targeted under the World Food Program and other organizations. The targeted population is mainly composed by smallholder  farmers who depend on the productivity  of small plots of land.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world. It has a population of 15.9 million. Agriculture is the main source of income for almost 85% of the people, and  most of them are smallholder farmers. The country faces a number of disasters, both natural and human-made, including floods, drought, landslides and HIV/AIDS and gender issues. Between 2011 and 2012 agricultural seasons were threatened by erratic seasonal rains and prolonged dry spells. Furthermore, intensity and frequency of disasters has been increasing, mainly due to climate change, population growth, urbanization and environmental degradation. The situation became aggravated by the raise of food prices. This measure severely affected the food security in the region, leaving smallholder farmers in a vulnerable situation. Cordaid and implementing partner CADECOM (Development Commission of Episcopal Conference of Malawi) help food insecure families to alleviate hunger through emergency and early recovery responses.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The project runs from August 2012 to May 2013. The main activities of the project involve: 

- Food for work program
- Distribution of seed inputs
- Mobilization and sensitization at local level
- Distribution of food commodities at Diocesan level.
- Registration and verification of beneficiaries.
- Distribution of ration cards.
- Food distribution exercise; including procurement, logistics, targeting and management.
- Establishment of tendering and supply contracts.
- Planning workshops with diocesan staff
- HIV/AIDS information and education sessions
- Deliver agriculture  training and advice 
- Training on Disaster Risk Reduction 
- Onsite and Post distribution monitoring
- Technical support to Disaster Risk Reduction and Food Security interventions
- Planning / training on SPHERE standard;
- Undertake participatory evaluations

</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: This is part of an emergency response strategy. Under emergency situations the nature of the aid provided will mainly be oriented to provide short term solutions to meet crucial basic needs of affected and displaced families. At this phase the main priority is to provide affected families with sufficient access to basic services such as food packages, ration cards, and basic items to foster the recovery of their livelihoods.  Even though this is a short term intervention, we aim to maximize the long term impacts on the family’s livelihoods and environment. To ensure this long term effects, beneficiaries are tough on the use and re- use of supplied materials. Beneficiaries also receive trainings on shelter construction and ensure the proper dissemination of these practices among the community. Other element that enhances the sustainability and long term effects of our projects is working through local partners. We believe that people knows best how to solve their own problems. That is why we work in partnership with local organizations that understand, and are part of the local culture. Furthermore, through every step of the project implementation, we aim to inspire community ownership.  For a project to be truly successful communities must be viewed and view themselves as the owners of the project.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: According to latest report (January 2013)  the following have been achieved 
1.	Community food security, disaster prevention &amp; mitigation measures are initiated in 75 villages as Food for Work projects 
2.	905 most vulnerable households received monthly food rations during 5 months
3.	5,135 households engaged in food for work activities for five months.
4.	Information, Education and Communication sessions on the prevention and mitigation of HIV/AIDS and gender messages delivered at 34 food distribution points.
5.	Seed packs distributed to 5,135 households.

    <description type="1">Subtitle: Improve referral and datamanagement of pregnant women</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The ICT in women’s health project is to be implemented in Chikwawa Diocese by the Catholic Health Commission in partnership with Montfort Hospital. The project will be implemented in 6 group villages in Chikwawa district targeting women and men of reproductive age. The goal of the project is ‘improved referral and data management of pregnant mothers to the health facilities using ICT’.

 

</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: 1.         To strengthen the institutional and community structures on MCH by December 2014

2.         To improve communication between the health facility and community on safe motherhood issues by December 2014

3.         To improve data management at health facility and community levels by December 2014

 
</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: 1500 pregnant women and 1500 infants per year </description>
    <description type="1">Background: In Malawi, 5 % of reproductive age population is pregnant at any particular time. Of these pregnant women 675 per 100,000 die of avoidable pregnancy related complication according to the Malawi health demographic survey 2010.
 
The main causes for maternal deaths in Malawi as are sepsis, haemorrhage, prolonged/obstructed labour; (pre-)eclampsia, complications of abortion, HIV/AIDS, malaria and anaemia. The underlying causes of all these include inadequate access to information and essential maternal health services, inadequate infrastructure for maternal and neonatal care, severe shortage of health personnel and long distances to the health facility.

Montfort hospital takes care of a population of 100,000 people of which around 1500 womer are pregnant per year.

Infant mortality rate is also high with 70 infants deaths per 1000. This is normally due to complications of the mother during delivery and inadeaquate equipment to resuscitate the infants after birth. </description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: •	To increase timely referral of pregnant mothers between community and Montfort hospital  for  delivery from 48% to 63% by 2014 

	. Conduct 4 sessions for HSAs, TBAs and Safe motherhood committees on safe motherhood
	Renovation of a guardian shelter
	Procure 6 ambulance bicycles.
	Procure  hardware (15  Cell phones, 15  Solar chargers, 5 Tablets
1 Computer, 1 External hard drive)
	Conduct 3 phone usage training  for Safe motherhood committees, HSAs, TBAs and health facility staff
	Conduct 1 Computer literacy training for safe motherhood committees, HSAs and health facility staff
 
•	To increase  antenatal care visits of pregnant women from the targeted community surrounding    Montfort hospital from 1 to 4 by 2014

	Conduct  122 outreach clinics for ANC and under-five clinic
	Renovation of 6 ANC outreach clinics
	Renovate Montfort hospital antenatal clinic

•	To promote active  involvement of men and community leaders on maternal and infant care by 2014
	Conduct 24 Dialogue sessions on maternal issues
	Conduct 6 advocacy meetings
	Develop helpful safe mother hood tips
	Conduct  8 stakeholder sensitization meeting
	Establishing male safe motherhood Committees (Male Champions)

•	To increase number of under five children attending monthly under five clinics by 2014
	Conducting awareness campaigns on importance of under clinics.
	Conducting monthly under five clinics in the community
</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The project puts three measures as its sustainability strategies
1.	Capacity building
The community groups will be taught about importance of antenatal services, hospital delivery and postnatal care. Once the community knows the importance of these services it is very easy for the project activities to continue beyond its life time.
2.	Involvement of government stakeholders
The project will work with Montfort hospital and HSAs who are right there in the communities. One of the HSAs’ core functions is to provide information and services on women health. As such the project activities are likely to be absorbed in their system and continue after the project life.
3.	Strengthening community structure
The project will not create any new structure other than working with the already existing community structures. This will promote project ownership hence the project will be sustainable.

    <title>Closing gap in maternal and neonatal health </title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Making a difference by accessible SRH-services in rural Northern Malawi</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality rates in Malawi remain at levels. This project will be implemented in Lunjika and Endindeni Health Centers, in Mzimba District, and the surrounding catchment areas.  The strategies include empowering women and young people to facilitate community action on maternal and neonatal health and family planning and address challenges in a holistic way. 
</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: Improved maternal and neonatal health outcomes at Lunjika and Endindeni health centers and its catchment areas.
Short term objectives (by year 2015):
(i) To increase the number of pregnant women accessing timely and comprehensive services from 17.7% to 60%.
(ii) To promote exclusive breast feeding.
(iii) To increase the number of people (reproductive age) accessing modern contraceptives from 56 % to 65 %.
(iv) To improve quality of reproductive health services at community and facility levels, with special focus on maternal and neonatal health. 
(v) To promote youth friendly health services.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: Direct target groups:
7.914 Women of Child Bearing age
1.450 Pregnant Women
1.450 Neonates 
1.450 Adolescents/Youth 

Indirect targetgroup:
21.704 Community members</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Women and young people in the target catchment areas are amongst the poorest and most marginalized having little understanding of their rights and experiencing inadequate nutrition, education and health care.  Communities largely rely on subsistence agriculture and some remittances from male family members who have migrated to find work. Cultural influences and low literacy levels mean that most women are not empowered to make decisions regarding their sexual reproductive health and often end up with either large families and / or poor health.
The direct target groups face significant obstacles to accessing quality reproductive health care. To remove the financial barrier to accessing services AHS is subsidizing the cost of MNH services at Lunjika Health Centre to ensure pregnant women, mothers and their neonates do not delay care seeking and/or have to undertake arduous journeys to the nearest government health center where services are free. </description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The project will implement interventions to directly address the 3 delays and achieve the objectives.  It will also address critical health challenges that have a direct impact on the health of pregnant women, lactating mother and neonates.  Community level interventions will seek to raise the -awareness of women and young people on maternal and reproductive health issues and the challenges they face, and empower them to take action to address their challenges.  Community leaders and men will be supported to become champions of improved maternal and reproductive health.  Community health service providers will have their skills upgraded; they will support community initiatives, improve referral practice, and track the health of every woman and newborn in their community.  These interventions will address delays 1 and 2, and delay 3 in respect of quality care provision in the community, and the basic health challenges that impact on MNH. Availability of essential drugs at facility level will be addressed.  Professional staff will have their skills upgraded and take part in a mentorship program that will support and motivate them to a higher level of performance, including improved monitoring and case management of all pregnant women.  These interventions will address delay number 3.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: Part of the program interventions consist of building the capacity at community and health facility level to deal better with SRH-problems.  Once knowledge and skills are instilled, they will not disappear so easily.  
</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: In 2009 AHS embarked on a maternal and neonatal health (MNH) improvement program in its 13 health centers providing full maternity services, including Lunjika. Significant improvements have been made in increasing Ante Natal Care (ANC) attendance and delivery at health centers and improving the quality of care provided. However, much remains to be done both at community and facility level.  In addition AHS has recognized the need to and value of addressing reproductive, maternal and neonatal health challenges through a holistic approach. </description>

    <description type="1">Subtitle: Assessing the impact of strengthening health systems in Malawi through ICT
</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Since 2009, IICD and Cordaid have significantly invested in the strengthening of electronic Health Information Systems (eHIS) by implementing AfyaPro at Nkhoma Hospital. The University of Edinburgh’s Global Health Academy (GHA) is rolling out AfyaPro to 9 rural health centers that refer patients to Nkhoma Hospital.  The evaluation will assess the impact and it will incude a cost benefit analysis.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: While the potential of eHIS to improve patient outcomes in low- and medium- income countries is widely recognised, there remains little high quality evidence to substantiate this, which hinders informed policy-making and practice.  This evaluation will contribute to filling this lack of evidence.  </description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: Nkhoma Hospital and the nine health centers, their health workers and the patients are targetgroups for the impact evaluation.  
Articles will be published, which will reach a national (Malawi)and international public. These can be considered as the indirect targetgroup.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: While the potential of eHIS to improve patient outcomes in low- and medium- income countries is widely recognized, there remains little quality evidence to substantiate this, which hinders informed policy-making and practice. The evaluation of this project will use mixed methods to assess the ways in which the rollout of AfyaPro to rural health centers influences the quality of their data capture, their use of information for decision making, the quality and efficiency of care, the speed of appropriate referrals to Nkhoma and rates of morbidity and mortality due to complications.  It will also examine the relative costs and benefits of implementation.  It will assess ‘hard’ impacts on clinical outcomes and efficiency, as well as ‘soft’ impacts on patient and staff satisfaction and perceived care quality.  Assessment of the factors that affect decision making is necessary to diagnose where to intervene with activities to improve demand for and use of data (Nutley, 2012).</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: 1. Research protocol
2. The impact of an eHIS on quality of care and health facility management in 9 health centers in central Malawi: baseline study.
3. Cost-benefit analysis of an eHIS at Nkhoma Hospital, Malawi
4. The impact of an eHIS on quality of care and health facility management at Nkhoma Hospital, Malawi
5. Cost-benefit analysis of an eHIS at 9 health centres in central Malawi
6. The impact of an eHIS on quality of care and health facility management in 9 health centres in central Malawi: a pre-post intervention study.
</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: Lessons learnt from this impact evaluation will contribute to the sustainability of the project.
</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: Since 2009, the International Institute for Communication and Development (IICD), ICCO and since 2011 Cordaid have significantly increased commitments to and investments in the strengthening of eHIS by implementing AfyaPro at Nkhoma Hospital. </description>

    <title>Clean Cooking Stoves for rural households </title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Distribution of 1.000 clean cooking stoves in Malawi</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Cordaid works together with the Dutch Foundation St. Gabriel's Hospital Malawi and Cadecom National Office in this project. The project consists of the distribution of 1.000 clean cooking stoves of the type Environfit. Cadecom will distribute these stoves in rural villages starting with Chineyata and Dickisoni. </description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The goal of the project is to distribute 1.000 clean cooking stoves, which will lead to a healthier environment for the women to cook and a reduction of the amount of wood needed for cooking.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The first target group is the foundation St. Gabriel's Hospital Malawi. The final beneficiaries are the women buying and using the cooking stoves.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: The Dutch Foundation St. Gabriel's Hospital Malawi and Cadecom have implemented in April 2013 the first phase of this project by distribution of 625 stoves to rural households in Lilongwe, Mchinji and Dowa districts at a selling price of Mk 2.500. Almost 90% of the beneficiaries are using the stoves.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The Dutch foundation will deliver 1.000 stoves to Cadecom Lilongwe. Cadecom will sell those stoves in rural households for a selling price of Mkw. 2.500.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The stoves only need to be replaced after 5 to 8 years. It is expected that by that time the demand for these stoves has increased to such a level that the stoves can be produced in the country, and prices will reduce.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: Cordaid has funded other projects of the Foundation St. Gabriel's Hospital Malawi in recent years.</description>

    <title>Karonga CMDRR &amp; Climate Change Adaptation</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Building resilient communities in Karonga</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Vulnerable communities in Malawi receive capacity building on Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction. This program helps them to reduce their vulnerability to risks of hazards through increasing individual survivability and community readiness.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The overall objective of the programme is to reduce community risk to natural hazards and to increase community resilience, through implementation of disaster risk interventions and promotion of agro-based income generating activities in kyungu and Mwakawoko in Karonga by 2014. </description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The program targets 3000 households of the targeted areas. Due to effect of HIV and AIDS on the well-being of the communities, the program gives special attention to vulnerable groups such as orphans, widows and people living with HIV and AIDS. </description>
    <description type="1">Background: Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world. It has a population of 15.9 million. Agriculture is the main source of income to almost 85% of the population, and most of them are smallholder farmers. The country faces a number of disasters, both natural and human-made, including floods, drought, landslides and HIV/AIDS and gender issues. These hazards threat people’s livelihoods, endanger human and food security, damage infrastructure and hinders socio-economic development. Currently the agricultural season is threatened by erratic seasonal rains and prolonged dry spells. Also the North of Malawi is very disaster prone for droughts and floods. Cordaid and implementing partner ARCOD help vulnerable families to reduce risks to natural hazards and to increase community resilience through the implementation of disaster risk interventions and promotion of agro-based income generating activities.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The programme runs from September 2012 to August 2013. In order to achieve the programme goal, the programme focuses on  the following specific objectives: 

1. To reduce community risk to flood through river bank protection, hotspot dyking and rainwater harvesting technologies.
2. To increase community resilience to drought through agricultural diversification and promotion of agriculture as a business.
3. To mitigate the impact of climate change through implementation of climate change adaptation techniques that includes re-afforestation, rehabilitation of catchment areas and woodlot establishment.
4. To increase community access to markets for their agricultural produce and get value for their produce,
5. To build the capacity of stakeholders and households in community managed disasters risk reduction, climate change adaptation and farming as a business.
6. To implement core activities that will ensure that the program achieves its goals and objectives by 2013.

Main activities involve:

- Undertake measures on Disaster Risk Reduction 
- Undertake measures on community resilience to disasters, by promoting farming as business, and by promoting families to engage in agro- based income generating activities.
- Undertake actions to improve access to markets. 
- Promote Climate Change and Adaptation interventions, through the promotion of re-afforestation of hills and mountains, woodlot establishment in  uncultivable bare grounds.
- Provide capacity building and trainings to beneficiary households on diverse components of the program.
- Undertake program core activities, such as Quarterly Review Meetings, Project Launch, Monitoring and Supervision and Planning Meetings at different stages of program implementation
</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction approach aims to deliver sustainable results. Elements that increase sustainability are: 
-Working through local partner ARCOD. We believe that local people know best how to solve their own problems. Locally based partners are better positioned to understand and navigate social, political, environmental and economic issues that will ultimately impact the project.
- An important component of the project is the capacitation on irrigation farming. Households practice irrigation farming as an income generating activity. The income realized from sales is deposited at a group account that will be used for procurement of inputs in the next growing season. Beneficiaries will be encouraged to open a group account where part of the proceeds from the sales will be kept for sustainability of the initiative.
- The tools used encourage participative monitoring through periodic reviews and fields visits. This will enable communities participating in this project be involved in monitoring. This will be one way of building ownership of the programme and hence sustainability.

</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: At present the following results have been delivered:
- River bank protection: Three rivers protected namely Lwasho in Kyungu, Hara in Wasambo, Sabi in Mwirang’ombe, through the plantation of 15600 trees seedlings.
- Crops and houses which were at flood risk are protected.
- Catchment areas re-afforested. It is everyone’s responsibility to look after planted trees. Local leaders will enforce the by-laws to owners of animals that browse planted trees.
- Communities use early warning systems to warn others against impending floods, storms or drought.

    <description type="1">Subtitle: To provide farmers basic information in order to reduce the rural disasters</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The monthly Rural Basic Needs Basket survey measures the living conditions of rural communities. It looks at the household's situation: level of  food security, consumption patterns, cost of non-food items and access to social amenities such as markets, education and health. Findings are shared in  communities and at district and national levels and used to influence price and food policies.

</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The Rural Basic Needs Basket survey is an instrument to measure the living conditions of the people in the rural areas where the community managed disaster risk reduction (CMDRR) programme is being implemented. The Diocesan Cedecoms will use findings of the survey to document best practices in the CMDRR programme for lobby and learning. </description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: To learn to work with the Rural Basic Needs Basket, Cadecom starts in two communities in the dioceses of Mangochi and Blantyre.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Although communities learn to prepare themselves for disasters through livelihood sources diversification, most of the communities do not have an idea on how much food in terms of quantity and quality or resources they need in a specific period, i.e a month or year. CADECOM believes that this information is very critical in disaster preparedness. Communities, especially in the rural areas, have no idea of their basic needs basket. </description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: This is a summary of the project plan: 
First of all, meetings with local government agencies, traditional leader and communities meetings will be held to conduct awareness on the introduction of RBNB project.
Secondly, data collectors and coordinators will be selected and trained. They will do the data collection and aggregation. to carry out these activities. The first round will serve as baseline survey. Thereafter, every months the same households will be visited and asked the same questions to picure the living conditions of these households. A specified data collection template will be used.
Finding will be shared with all the relevant stakeholders in the selected area, like the District Executive Committee (DEC), the Member of Parliament for the area, the Traditional Authority (T/A) and all concerned local chiefs, heads of government departments and ministries at district level, religious leaders and NGOs working in the selected area.

To get exact data, households are given note books in which they record any food item they consume, money spent on food and non food items, and cash acquired from different types of income sources. The data collectors visit these households once a month and transfer the information  into data sheets.
Data collectorsget a small remuneration for the work they do and the households a small incentive in kind (like matsches and soap)
Overall montioring is done by Cadecom National Office and Centre for Social Concern (the Malawian NGO who developed the Basic Needs Basket survey a couple of years ago).
</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: By the use of the Rural Basic Needs Basket survey Diocesan Cadecoms and communities gain insight in income and expenditure of households during the year and when bottlenecks (income and food deficits) occur. This helps Cadecom and the communities to formulate better plans and lobby messages to get access to government programmes or influence food price policies.
The Rural Basic Needs Basket:
	is an indicator of the socioeconomic situation across Malawi.
	highlights the gap between the recommended calorie intake and the actual calorie intake.
	highlights the typical monthly income and expenditure levels of ordinary Malawian rural families.
	is the target for all development agencies to aim for when working towards a just and dignified society.
	is a tool to use when advocating for change, justice, a fairer policy or a dignified existence.
	is a guide for all rural households in deciding how best to do food and income budgeting to meet their basic needs.

    <description type="1">Initial Situation: The workshop Integrating Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction and Agricultural Entreprreneurship was held in July 2012 in Lilonge, organised by the national office of Cadecom, with support from Cordaid and NASFAM (National Smallholders Association of Malawi). Also few staff members of the national office participated in the workshop. At the end of the workshop participants were invited to submit action plans for capactiy building in their own organisation.</description>

    <title>Human Resources in Health Coalition</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Contributing to a solution for the Human Resources in Health crisis</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Civil society organizations have an important role to play in engaging and influencing the allocation of resources towards the training, retention and deployment of health care workers, creating an environment that attracts and facilitates the effective delivery of services by health care workers, and ensuring that Government meets its obligation of a healthy and productive nation.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: Goal: To influence Government to increase the health sector budget allocation to at least 15% of total government spending in line with Abuja Declaration by 2015. 

Objectives by 2015:
1.	To contribute towards improving working and living conditions of healthcare professionals. 
2.	To promote conducive learning conditions in training institutions by advocating for adequate government sponsorship and smooth disbursement.
3.	To advocate for incentives to promote retention in hard to reach areas.
4.	To improve the coordination and capacity of civil society organizations. 
</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: 	PRIMARY AUDIENCE
Ministers and Principal Secretaries from Ministries of Health, Education and Finance. 

	SECONDARY AUDIENCES
30 Members of Parliament from Health, Budget, Finance and HIV and AIDS committees; heads of donor and development partners including International Financing Institutions such as IMF and those in health especially those supporting the HSSP; relevant Directors from Ministries of Health, Education and Finance.
</description>
    <description type="1">Background: The low supply of health care workers continues to hinder progress on achieving development milestones. In Malawi, for example, the vacancy rate for nurses currently 1 nurse takes care of over 2,600  people against the recommended 1 nurse per 1,000 people. The population to physician ratio stands at 50,000 to 1 against the recommended 5,000 to 1. The rural-urban dichotomy in health worker staffing levels may explain the disparities in health service coverage between rural and urban dwellers. 
Over the years steps have been taken to address the shortage. The Emergency Human Resources Program with support from DfID was a six-year program designed in 2004 and introduced a 52% salary top up on 11 cadres of health workers. Another element of the program was to increase the capacity to train eleven priority health care cadres The Ministry of Health affirms to maintain the salary top up, extend housing scheme and institutionalize a  scheme improving retention (MoH, 2011). 
</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The following activities will be conducted to achieve the project objectives:    
	Hold lobby meetings with Parliamentary Committees on Health, Budget and Finance, and HIV and AIDS to improve HRH situation.
	Hold lobbying meetings with Ministries of Health, Education and Finance
	Hold lobby meetings with donors and development partners in health sector on the need to support HRH initiatives.
	Conduct consultative meetings at regional/zone levels with zone and district health management teams to understand the HRH situation and mobilize their support. 
	Conduct meetings at regional and zone levels with nursing colleges management to mobilize their support 
	Reconstitute the Coalition by bringing in new members, and revisiting the composition of the steering committee.
	Hold national HRH coalition partner meetings to share progress, build consensus, and plan for national HRH actions. 
	Conduct national stakeholders reviews sessions. 
	Engage the media as key allies on HRH coalition activities.
	Document and disseminate information through the media and award excellent media for HRH coverage to prioritize HRH to the public and mobilize support.
	Document and package stories on HRH situation and problems the health sector is facing due to HRH situation as a basis for advocacy.
	Develop capacity of HRH Coalition members in advocacy, lobbying skills, coalition building
	Manage, monitor and evaluate the project through recruitment of project Desk Officer, project evaluation and audit. 
	Facilitate engagement meetings between health facility advisory committee and other community leaders and health care workers.
</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The implementation of EHRP which resulted in increased retention and enrolment is evidence that Malawi can tame brain drain as well as improve supply of health care workers through increased training if there is sufficient financial support to the health sector. EHRP included a 52% taxable salary top up, housing and other incentives to practicing health care workers in 11 cadres and training support to health professional students. The implementation of EHRP through the Program of Work (PoW I) led to the number of health workers and their retention improving from figures prior to 2004. Similarly, evidence shows that there has been an increase of 50% in health workforce and enrolment in training institutions (WHO, 2012). 

Evidence suggests a positive correlation between health inputs and health outcomes. For example, increase in percentage of births supported by skilled health professionals from 54% in 2004 to 71% in 2010 is associated with a decline in maternal mortality rate from 807 per 100,000 live births to 675 per 100,000 live births over the same period (MoH, 2004; MoH, 2010). Cumulative improvement in health inputs though still low has seen the country’s life expectancy improving from 42 years to 54.2 years (UNDP, 2012).

Therefor it is worth to keep on lobbying and advocating for maintaining and improving the HRH-situation.
</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: The HRH Coalition has learnt that it is possible to successfully lobby. Coordination amongst diverse organizations, a strong lead organization, mobilized beneficiaries, and support from allies are vital for influencing policy making. Additionally, partnerships at all levels provide the platform that leads to successful policy and decision making. Examples of achievements of the HRH Coalition include the successfully influencing from October 2009 to July 2010 of government and development partners to reconsider providing scholarships to mid-level health care professionals in Malawi.

    <title>small producers, agriculture and CMDRR</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Integration of agricultural entrepreneurship and disaster risk reduction</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: In seven rural communities of Rumphi and Mzimba districts 5000 households of small producers benefit from this project. The people set up marketing channels like cooperatives and road side marketing places, while in agriculture they take measures against erosion and harvest losses. Each community will have civil protection committee for joint action on disaster preparedness and prevention.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: After three years the livelhood of 5000 households of small producers will be improved through promotion of entrepreneurship and marketing of their farm and non farm production and through capacity building on integrating community managed disaster risk reduction and entrepreneurhsip. Their communities will resilient to different hazards.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The 5000 direct beneficiaries from the seven communites are divided in two groups: 3400 are small rural entrepreneurs (2000 women and 1400 men) and and 1600 small farmers (700 women and 900 men). All are involved in production or marketing of different types of crops, livestock or fish in disaster prone communities.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Malawi  is one of the most densely populated and least developed countries. About 80 percent of the population lives in rural areas and depends largely on agriculture. Rumphi and Mzimba are rural districts are located in the northern part of Malawi. These districts are regularly struck by local or larger disasters like stong winds, floods, heavy and unpredictable rains, dry spells, outbreak of liveshock diseases and pests in crops. Although a wide range of crops is produced and partly sold, such as tomatoes, onions, cassave, bananas, sugarcane and sweet potato, farmers income is low due to lack of proper market structures and poor roads, but also poor quality. The introduction of a proper marketing system, integration of fish farming through ponds and liveshock would act as good mitigation measures against major hazards.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: Under the objective of promoting entrepreneurhsip among 3400 small producers and improving marketing of their own farm and non farm produce, the project will realise the following activities:
- establishment of 4 cooperatives
- construction of 5 raodside market shelters
- link all producers to transporters
- promotion of 500 village savings and loan associations of 10 members each
- promotion of packaging of products
- training entrepreneurs on post harvest handling.

Under the objective of buuilding capacity of 1600 small producers on integrating community managed disaster risk reduction and agribusiness, there are two distictive categories of activities:
Regarding preventive and preparedness measures the activities are:
- construction of bunds and ridges along rivers and flood prone areas
- training of communities on the CMDRR concepts
- formation of at least 10 civil protection committees in villages and at area and district levels.
- promotion of conservation of natural village forests.
Regarding mitigation measures the activities are:
- promotion of small scale irrigation among small producers
- prmotion of beekeeping in reforested areas
- planting of 5000 fruit trees and bananas along river banks and on bunds and ridges
- promotion of integration fish farming, poultry and livestock raising</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The 5000 targeted households will increase or improve their livelihood and business activities, thus increasing their income. Membership based structures like cooperatives and village savings and loan groups will sustain these activities and give people control over their assets and income. Four cooperatives will be formed and functional. Of the 500 savings and loan groups at least 10 percent will be linked to financial institutions and agricultural business dealers. Through agricultural conservation measures and planting grasses and fruit trees on water retaining ridges, disaster risks of floods and droughts will  reduce and agricultural production will increase. Beter storage facilites will reduce post harvest losses. In each community a village civil protection committee will be formed, trained and functional as partner of the local government. These economic as well as disaster risk reduction measures all contribute to sustainability. Besides SPRODETA pays attention to gender by specifically targeting women and ensuring their leadership in committees, cooperatives and savings and loan groups. </description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: Small Producers Development and Transporters Association was formed in 2009. SPRODETA developed this project from the lessons learnt over the past year of implementing the pilot project 'Enhanced resilience for small producers through communit managed disaster risk reduction' (with support from Cordaid) and a baseline survey conducted in the area. Some of the learnings are to put stonger emphasis on use of existing assets and capabilities of people and communties and to give people a voice through participation in cooperatives and civil protection committees.</description>

    <title>integrating farming and risk reduction</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Cadecom Mzuzu supports disaster risk reduction and farmer entrepreneurship</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: In Mzuzu diocese the Catholic Development Committee (Cadecom) is supporting farmers in their efforts to gain access to local markets in one district. In another district Cadecom Mzuzu is assisting farmers in coping with natural hazards and in reducing disaster risks. This new project integrates farming as a business and disaster risk reduction in both areas. </description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: Staff of Cadecom Mzuzu need new skills and knowledge to sustain and improve people's livelihoods, not only in reducing risks of disasters but also to strengthen their economic base.  </description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The target group consists of rural communities in Mzuzu diocese, totaling 3000 households (15000 people ) as direct beneficiaries.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Cadecom Mzuzu is currently implementing two projects. The first is an access to markets project in Mzimba district. About 1.500 farmers, with limited access to markets, benefit from activities to increase crop production and  marketing surplus production. The second is a Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction (CMDRR) project in Kasungu North, benefitting 11 communities. Its focus lies on decreasing environmental degradation and coping with droughts. Combining the approaches of CMDRR and of entrepreneurship helps to diversify choice of crop production for own consumption and cash income as well as spread risks in agricultural practises, by not relying on one or two crops. </description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The project takes place in different steps:
- The three most senior and experienced staff of Cadecom will conduct a Trainers of Trainers workshop for 15 colleagues, with support from external experts.
- Trained colleagues will organize awareness raising meetings in the targeted communities
- Trainers and communities will start implementing activities together. 
Examples of planned activities are training and exposure visits in the fields of on cooperative development, conservation agriculture, smallscale irrigation, market research and value chain development, entrepreneurship, the use of energy saving stoves and the CMDRR approach.

</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: Staff of Cadecom Mzuzu will tranfer their new knowledge and skills to local farming communities, thereby sustainably strengthening communities in DRR as well as farming as a business.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: Two staff members of Cadecom Mzuzu participated in the workshop Integrating Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction and Agricultural Entreprreneurship. This workshop took place in July 2012 in Lilonge. Ti was, organized by the national secretariat of Cadecom, with support from Cordaid and NASFAM (the National Smallholder Farmers Association of Malawi). At the end of the workshop participants were invited to submit action plans for capacity building in their own organization. Cadecom Mzuzu has submitted the action plan as described here.</description>

    <title>Resocialization project boys in Mikuyu Prison</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Boys from Mikuyu prison resocialized and reintegrated into the community.</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Cordaid works together with the Dutch Foundation Byounique and its local partnerorganization Byounique Trust Malawi on behalf of this project. The project focuses on the boys imprisoned in the Mikuyu prison, close to Zomba in the South of Malawi. The project consists of activities in the field of prevention, resocialization into the community and awareness raising.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The goal of the project is:
- to improve the situation of children and youth at police stations and in youth prisons in the area of Zomba and Blantyre;
- to provide prevention information in Eastern Region;
- to realize general awareness of the situation of children in prisons in the whole country via the media.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The direct target group of the project are the 350 boys imprisoned in Mikuyu Prison.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: The Foundation Byounique decided to start its program in Malawi with a project aimed at young offenders in Mikuyu because the boys detained in this facility are urgently in need of special care, at least for 2 reasons:
- The circumstances in which these boys stay at the prison are rough, as they lack all basic needs.
- The boys are not offered any possibilities to prepare themselves for their life after discharge.

Because of these circumstances, the development of these boys is threatened and the chances of recidivism and re-offending are high. This project offers a possibility to avoid this.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: During 2014 the following activities will be implemented:

Resocialization for each boy, starting from 6 till 4 months before discharge from prison:
- Individual and group counselling;
- Tracing of the families of the boys and family counselling;
- Support in finding accomodation, school or employment;
- Follow up during 9 months after release from prison

Prevention:
- Providing school fees for vulnerable boys for secondary school;
- A training program on behaviour change for youth who are first offenders

Awareness raising on the difficult situation of children and youth in prisons:
- Training of staff working at the prisons;
- Awareness raising to government staff and partner organizations;
- Awareness raising to the communities and religious leaders.
</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The project is implemented by the local partner organization. Capacity building of this organization by staff training is an essential part of this project in order to gradually hand over the responsiblities of the Dutch Foundation to the local organization. </description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: This is the first project of the Foundation Byounique, which is supported by Cordaid.</description>

    <title>Improving pregnancy outcomes</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Submitted by the Consurtium for Maternal and Newborn Survival in Malawi</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The major causes of maternal death are preventable or can be managed if quality Emergency Obstetric Care services are available and used. In resource poor setting such as Malawi, the high maternal mortality is usually attributed to the “3 delays” that is 1) delay in deciding to seek care, 2) delay in reaching care in time, and 3) delay in receiving adequate treatment.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The overall goal of the project is to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality by 15% in Kasungu and Mzimba Districts by 2015.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The primary target  group will be: 190,930 women in the child bearing age (41,507 expected deliveries per year) including 83,013 adolescents aged 15-19 years. 41,507 children under-one year of age, 600 health workers that include both those working in the preventive and curative sections in the 6 Supervision Areas.  
The project will also reach the following indirect beneficiaries:  91,647 men, 1,646 local leaders and 3,292 community volunteers.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Malawi has a high maternal mortality of 675/100,000 live births with 20 per cent from teenagers. 
The majority of rural women have limited access to family planning and essential obstetric care services and those living outside of urban centres have limited access to maternal and newborn health services whose quality meets nationally acceptable standards. Most services are geared towards married pregnant women with adequate support to access transportation.  
This proposal also takes into consideration the principal determinants of the second delay in Malawi. Poor access to obstetric services due to inadequate number of health facilities particularly in out laying areas.  
The Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care (EmONC) assessment of 2010 found that only 2 per cent of health centres are providing basic emergency obstetric care (BEmONC). 
The recent 2013 survey in Mzimba and Kasungu districts showed that 72% and 74% of mothers respectively have an unmet need for family planning. 


</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: Objective 1: Increasing offer and uptake of family planning services and avoidance of the risks of abortions focusing on adolescents and young mothers.
	Support training of health workers on youth friendly reproductive health service provision
The program will train an additional 100 health workers in the two districts to scale up Adolescent Youth Reproductive Health Services. The training will use standard manuals developed by MoH

	Support health facilities to provide the minimum service package of Youth Friendly Reproductive Health Services
A total of 5 health facilities in the two districts will be supported so that they provide comprehensive youth friendly health services. Support will be in form of furniture, equipment and start up kits. The sites will be linked to the district hospitals for continuous technical and logistical support.

	Develop and disseminate IEC materials  
The program will link with the Health Education Department to develop, print and disseminate IEC materials to mobilise the youth for YFH services in the target districts. The IEC materials will be in form of posters, leaflets and videos.

	Train YFHS peer educators 
In order to promote face to face communication, the program will train 300 peer educators in the two districts to scale up behaviour change communication. The peer educators will be linked to YFH sites and shall use attractive media outlets such as football, video shows and traditional dances.
 
	Integrate YFH services with multi-purpose youth recreation centres
Subject to receiving approval from the beneficiaries, the consortium partners shall establish 2 youth recreational centres where youth would be meeting to play games whilst also having access to YFH services to be offered at the same sites. 

	Ensure Continuous supply of commodities
The program will link up with the district hospital and central medical stores to ensure constant provision of supplies condoms and other family planning methods. 

Objective 2: Mobilize communities and support innovations to enable mothers to reach health facilities and be referred effectively to access emergency obstetric Care when needed. {DELAY 1 AND 2}
	Increase number of motorcycle ambulances
The project will scale up the ability of 25 health centres to evacuate women from villages and health centre level with motorcycle ambulances for perinatal and postnatal period emergencies and promote the procurement of ambulances for the rural and community hospitals designated to provide sub-district level EmONC services through partnerships among district level stakeholders.

	Pilot cash transfer mechanism
Assess the feasibility of decentralizing maternity waiting homes from district level to rural hospitals and selected health centres. Also assess the feasibility of providing cash transfer to women that could stay with relatives close to a health centre while waiting.

	Create linkages with local organizations, local leaders, men and TBAs to support MNH
The program shall mobilize men, local leaders, TBAs and community organizations to encourage mothers to take up early antenatal care and to become advocates for birth preparation and promotion of obstetric referral services within a home to hospital continuum of care. The mobilization will lead to formation of 125 Community Action Groups. The programme will work with 3292 volunteers and 1646 chiefs within the target areas.

	Introduce performance contracts
The project will support the development of EmONC performance contracts by CEmONC confluence area by defining the contribution and responsibilities of MOH and local government structures, community based organizations, NGOs and other stakeholders as well as families in ensuring access and utilization of basic and referral EmONC services to women particularly for those living in remote hard to reach areas. 

	Promote community post natal checks by HSAs
The program shall work with DHMTs and health facility staff to mobilise HSAs to carry out community post natal checks as per the new government policy. Tracking of post natal mothers and new born babies will be linked to the rapid sms system

Objective 3: Improving access and quality of reproductive health services {DELAY 3}
	Training of 600 health workers in integrated maternal and new born care
The focus of the training will be to reskill midwives to provide all the seven signal functions of BEmONC.  The training will focus on both ensuring that midwives have the knowledge but also the necessary skills and aptitude to use equipment and tools for this purpose. 

	Scale up EmONC services 
The program will support District Health Management Teams (DHMTs) in 25 health facilities to expand the provision of maternal and neonatal care services (with special focus on the necessary equipment for neonatal emergencies  based on a review of the existing capacities. the program shall work with DHMTs to ensure that EmONC services are being priotized and linked to referral units.

The program will provide start-up kits and more stringent quarterly supportive supervision and monitoring based on spot checks of equipment and supplies and technical reviews of supply chain and case management files. This will improve BEmONC and pre-referral quality of care when coupled with the improvement of the strengthening of the competence and duty staff roster management among health facility level skilled attendants. 


	Collaborate with  professional councils to improve standards of practice(SOP), guidelines, norms and protocols for national MNH and FP service 

The program will link with Kamuzu College of Nursing and other professional organizations such Medical Council of Malawi, Nurses and Midwife Association of Malawi to improve quality of EmONC services provided in the sites. Kamuzu College of Nursing will train and mentor nurses and midwives in the health facilities in the impact areas. Nurses and Midwives Council of Malawi will ensure quality performance through provision of guidance under the Continuous Professional Development (CPD) initiative. The Ministry of Health will be encouraged to provide some recognition to best performing health facilities on MNH.  

	Promote 48 hour waiting period at health facility to effect post natal care
Through local level partnership, increase the proportion of rural health facilities in the selected districts able to retain mothers and newborns for the required 48Hr observation period after normal deliveries to increase access to rapid management of early postnatal complications. Findings show that early release of mothers and new born babies is a consequence of space and noncompliance with RH policy by health workers. The program will re-orient all health workers on the importance of keeping in line with 48 hour waiting period. On space the project shall provide extra beds to increase the capacity of health facilities to accommodate more new born babies and their mothers.

	Apply performance &amp; quality improvement approaches to planning, supervision, monitoring &amp; evaluation of maternal, neonatal health services
Supervision is a critical component for continuously improving the quality of services and safeguarding high standards of care. Recent surveys have shown that both health facility and community based maternal and newborn care lack effective supportive supervision aimed at helping staff improve their practice. The program will support DHMTs and Zones to undertake effective supervisory processes in the facilities providing EmONC services.

	Updating of EmONC Maps
The program shall support the Ministry of Health (MOH) and District Health Management Teams (DHMTs) in updating maps of current health centres and their catchment areas in relation to the nearest hospital (district, rural and community hospitals) with a view of re-defining sub-district areas around EmONC confluence zones. This will allow determination of current pathways to EmONC services in all communities and changes needed to rapidly improve access  especially for the most remote and marginalized villages. This would also allow directing and leveraging technical and financial resources through local level partnerships to improve referral linkages. 

	Review and strengthen referral protocols at all levels of care
The project will facilitate a review of the referral protocols currently in use in the project area. The aim of the review will be to identify gaps and improve efficiency of the system. The review will cover the communication infrastructure in use and provide recommendations for improvements to the system. The project will identify and procure communication equipment and supplies needed for improving the referral system between the community and facility levels as well as between facilities.

In order to ensure continuum of care, the project will work the created or revamped community action groups to encourage timely community to facility referrals. This will be achieved through dissemination of IEC materials related to the roles of communities and health facilities in supporting the referral system. In particular, the short film “Why did Mrs X die” will be screened with in the communities

At the health facility level, health centre staff will be oriented on pre-referral and referral care for maternal and newborn survival.

</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The Ministry of Health is the implementer of the project at the facility and community level and hence is the main custodian of the intervention and will have technical support from both UNICEF and IHI. The existing MOH structures and frameworks will be used to implement proposed health services improvement activities at the district and sub-district level. Active participation of District Assemblies, local leaders and community based organizations will be solicited to promote community engagement and for. At the community level, collaboration will be done with multi-sectoral front line workers to disseminate information and key messages for behavioural change related to MNH. This will ensure a high level of sustainability as no new structures are envisaged.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: This is a new project, so no activities have been going on from the site of this consortium.</description>

    <title>Improving data management in Home Based Care</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Switching from manual to ICT based data management</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The dioceses and Rumphi district hospital and Bolero hospital use manual record keeping and reporting systems, which has several shortfalls. The switch to an ICT based system can greatly improve the way information is stored, retrieved and presented. The project will equip work stations with computers linked to a server. Data and patients records will be kept on the server.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: We aim to strengthen the Dioceses in supporting the population in their need for quality Home Based Care. The Dioceses and Rumphi and Bolero Hospitals aim with this project to improve medical record keeping, reporting and communication systems. This will result into improved patient care and health service delivery for Home Based Care-clients.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The direct target group is the Home Based Care-clients of the four Diocesan Home Based Care-program and the patients of Rumphi District hospital and Bolero rural hospital. </description>
    <description type="1">Background: There are mission hospitals, private hospitals and non-governmental organizations who work hand in hand with the government. The District Health office is the main health service provider. This office provides guidance to Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) on which communities need support or services. To do this, the district health office depends on reports from communities as well as health centers. This project will provide the district health office with current and accurate information. 

Currently medical records are kept by patients (for outpatients) and the records department (for inpatients). Most patients lose their records. It is also difficulty for the hospital to keep all medical records forever. This results in loss of medical records and as a result patients' care is not necessarily based on their health profile. </description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The following are the planned project activities:
- Dioceses of Chikwawa, Blantyre, Mangochi and Mzuzu:
1. Improving the quality of care for home based care clients, through improved data management and better communication with health workers. Initially, in the four dioceses 112 home care workers will be provided with mobile phones, which they will use for reporting, referral of patients to health facilities and getting feedback from the health facilities.
2. 40% more accurate and timely reporting of home care worker to community organization and community ganisation for Catholic Health Commission of Catholic Health Commission and other stakeholders to the end of 2012;
3. Improved feedback to health care worker after they have referred the end of 2012 compared to 2011, a patient;
4. The number of home care workers that goes annually reduced by 10% in late 2012.
Above will lead to improved compliance (ART, AIDS Medicines), a larger number of clients per home care worker and an improved referral of patients get help in time. In 2012, a proposal will be made ​​by the dioceses for 2013 and 2014, which focuses more on health care for women and that there will be a stronger link between the informal and formal care.

- Rumphi and Bolero Hospitals:	
1.	Briefing district health management teams and members of staff. It is during this meeting that the project ideas will be introduced to members of staff. We expect that members will fully understand the project and its benefits. Their contributions on project implementation will also be welcomed.
2.	Phase I activities: For Rumphi District Hospital will include procurement of hardware and system installation in outpatient departments, and administration department. The Out Patient departments are adult Out Patients departments, Children Out Patients departments and anti natal clinic. Phase I activities for Bolero will involve procurement of hardware for the following departments: outpatients department, officer in-charge’s office, children’s Out Patients departments, and anti natal clinic. Installation in these departments will be done at the beginning of phase II. Phase I runs from October 2011 to 31st December 2011. 
3.	Phase II activities: At Rumphi District Hospital hardware for scaling up to all wards and laboratory will be bought. Installation will also be done in these departments. At Bolero Rural Hospital, hardware for maternity and dispensary will be bought. The system will be install in Out Patients departments, maternity, dispensary, and the in the office of Hospital Management Information System focal person and of facility’s officer in-charge. Hardware for wireless link and its installation will also be done during this phase. System maintenance and project progress monitoring will also begin in this phase
4.	Phase III starts from January 2013 and ends on 31 December 2013. Activities of this phase include procurement of scale up hardware for both hospitals. At Rumphi District Hospital the system will be installed in the pharmacy, x-ray department, and theater and TB office. Anti-retro-viral Therapy clinic already has hardware installed. At Bolero rural hospital the system will be installed in the Laboratory, and Anti-retro-viral Therapy/VCT clinic. A resource center will be established at Rumphi District Hospital. The resource center will be offering internet and printing services to members of staff and the public. The revenue generated will be used for maintenance of the system.
5.	Review meetings with heads of sections, district health management team and project team will be held every three months to assess the progress of the project. 
6.	The system will be fully functional at Rumphi and Bolero hospitals by 31 December 2013. </description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The activities of the project will be incorporated into on-the-job training programs for the hospital.

The District Health Management Team (DHMT) sees this project as a milestone in as far as patient care, data management, communication, and service planning is concerned. The DHMT will start incorporating activities of the project into its yearly plans starting from next government financial year (July 2012 to June 2013).</description>

    <description type="1">Subtitle: Linking health &amp; education for sexual and reproductive health for youth</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: This pilot project wants to explore how to connect the Health and Education sector, how to improve the health services in such a way that they are being used by young people, and which other actors need to be involved to provide young people with full access to all services. Different tools and experiences that already exist will be used to see how to best fill this gap and enable scaling-up.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: To contribute to young people in Central and Northern Malawi living a healthy life, through linking Comprehensive Sexual Education to youth friendly SRH services, ultimately leading to reduced new STI &amp; HIV infections and teenage pregnancies.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The direct target groups of the project are:
720 young people (in standard 7 and 8, age 10-15 years) taking part in the CSE programmes in the 6 selected STAR schools
2500 young people (10-18 years) having access to the SRH and health related services in the project areas 

The indirect target groups of the project are:
6-10 health facilities staff and/or other providers
Staff and board in the 6 pilot schools
Parents/caretakers, communities
MOE and MOH</description>
    <description type="1">Background: ICCO CO, including Edukans /Educaids, Cordaid as well as STOP AIDS NOW! are all involved in programs intended to improve the SRHR of young people. Our entry points however differ: Edukans/Educaids do this through their formal and non-formal education programs and partners, ICCO CO and Cordaid do this, mainly, through SRH care provision with or without specific attention for the accessibility and appropriateness of these services for young people. STOP AIDS NOW! is known for its innovative programs, taking on the role as expert, knowledge gatherer and sharer. We all are convinced that we need to connect the education and health sector much more closely to improve on our results in relation to SRHR of young people. Better connecting both sectors contributes to the effectiveness of programs, their cost effectiveness (complementarity) and sustainability (broader embedded).

</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: Activities
Related to outcome 1: Effective linkages are created between 6 STAR-schools (that run a CSE program) and 6-10 SRH services in the project areas by December 2015.
 Conduct an exploratory study to identify obstacles and possibilities for creating linkages between school-based CSE programs and SRH services
 Conduct workshops to discuss the results with all the stakeholders and make plans to address the obstacles
 Develop and disseminate a referral guide for the youth in each project area
 Advocate for involvement of SRH services in the CSE programs at school level
 Create a referral system between the schools and the SRH services – including (different) reward mechanisms.

Related to outcome 2: 2500 young people (10-18 years) in the 6 selected pilot areas in Central and Northern Malawi have improved access to SRH services by December 2015.
 Conduct a participatory study among young people in the project area to identify the obstacles 
 Conduct workshops with the young people, the parents/caretakers, the schools, the clinics, the community to discuss the results of the study and formulate recommendations for making health services more youth friendly
 Build the capacity of 6-10 clinic health committee members to act as advocates for the youth friendly services
 Involve complementary service providers who are able to offer the missing services and create referral system
 Training and follow-up of service providers (health staff) and providers of complementary services in provision of youth friendly SRH services
 Develop data collection tools for the youth friendly component and assist youth or community organizations to collect data and feedback experiences to the health facilities
 Advocate with department of Health at district level for youth friendly community based distribution of contraceptives and possibly community-based HIV/ STI- testing
 Training of 30 peer educators 
 Support community mobilization activities. 

Related to outcome 3: Case evidence is provided on possibilities and limitations of a referral system for youth in Malawi that links youth in school-based CSE programs to (improved) youth-friendly public and private SRH services.
 External research institute will conduct operational research
 Implementing partners conduct outcome monitoring and evaluation
 Development of a practical document describing the case in such a way that findings can be used in other contexts

Related to outcome 4: Relevant stakeholders in Malawi as well as relevant organizations in other countries have shown interest in the integration of the recommendations from the case-study in their own programs.
 Producing and distributing updates among stakeholders in Malawi and interested organisations in other countries
 Conducting a webinar to share our experiences with international stakeholders
 Organizing an end-learning event (symposium) in Malawi involving all stakeholders
 Presenting the case at least at 1 international conference
 Write an article on the case material for publication
 Include the wider stakeholders in the end-learning event in Malawi
 Conduct advocacy meetings with relevant stakeholders throughout the project duration using evidence built </description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: Edukans/Educaids will continue to have a focus on life skills, including SRH related skills, in their education programs after 2015. The ICCO Cooperation will put even more emphasis on integrated programs, e.g. linking education to health, amongst others in Malawi after 2015. The findings of this pilot will be used for up-scaling in Malawi and other countries with school-based CSE programs.
Cordaid will continue to work on SRHR and will use the lessons learned to make services more youth friendly and link the education and health sector in its other countries as well. 
EEDF has an active relationship with the Malawi Institute of Education on development of age-appropriate CSE curricula in the coming years.
The 2 hospitals will continue working on making health services youth friendly.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: ICCO CO, including Edukans /Educaids, and Cordaid are both implementing programs intended to improve sexual and reproductive health and rights of young people. The entry points are different: Edukans/Educaids does this through the education sector, formal and non-formal, ICCO CO does this, mainly, through community-based, SRH care provision and Cordaid does this through health system strengthening (PBF) and SRH programs.</description>

</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Neno District, situated in the South West is one of the poorest areas. For instance, in 2011, only 7% of the pregnant women received care during their first trimester, while 66% sought skilled assistance during delivery. A majority of women rely on traditional birth attendants. Due to poor attendance for antenatal care, complications during pregnancy are often unnoticed. 
The fertility rate in the Southern region is estimated at 6.1 above the national average of 5.7 in the 2010 MDHS. Family planning utilization in the district is low, at 29% among women of reproductive age. Approximately 3506 pregnancies are reported, and 3260 newborns delivered annually., 
This application has considered poor infrastructural development as a barrier to adequate access for basic maternal, neonatal and child care by women in remote villages. It proposes a community based approach to transfer health services closer to women as well as providing affordable and accessible rural transport. 

</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: Objective 1: To increase the number of ANC visits per trimester by pregnant women from the 26 villages of TAs Dambe and Simon from  0, 1 &amp; 2 to 3 &amp; 4 visits by December 2014Conduct baseline KAP surveys and capacity assessment
- Establish 26 Women’s Groups
- Renovate community structures into women waiting homes
- Procure Health Centre equipment
- Procure capital assets
- Procure drugs and Medical Supplies
- Train 52 Women group members and 3 HCWs as maternal and child healthfacilitators for Women groups
  
Objective 2: To increase the number of pregnant women supported by skilled attendants during child delivery from the 26 villages in TAs Dambe and Simon from 51%  to 80% by December 2014
- Procure ICT equipment (Hardware and Software) 
- Conduct phone usage training  for Safe motherhood committees, HSAs, HCWs TBAs, HBC volunteers and health facility staff

Obiective 3: To increase number of quality MNCH and CHBC reports by the participating communities and health facilities in Neno and Phalombe districts by December 2014 
- Develop data collection tools
- Train HMIS team in management and use  of MNCH and CHBC data



</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The project puts three measures as its sustainability strategies
1.	Capacity building
The community groups will be taught about importance of antenatal services, hospital delivery and postnatal care. Once the community knows the importance of these services it is very easy for the project activities to continue beyond its life time.
2.	Involvement of government stakeholders
The project will work with Montfort hospital and HSAs who are right there in the communities. One of the HSAs’ core functions is to provide information and services on women health. As such the project activities are likely to be absorbed in their system and continue after the project life.
3.	Strengthening community structure
The project will not create any new structure other than working with the already existing community structures. This will promote project ownership hence the project will be sustainable.

    <title>Access to Care, Support &amp; Protection for OVCs</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Access to basic necessities</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The Mangochi district in Malawi is one of the poorest of the country. It has a very high rate of HIV prevalence, contributing to high levels of orphan hood. Most orphans are living under absolute poverty and lack access to basic necessities. This project considers the wider needs of these children by putting them at the centre of service provision through a Case Support System.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: We contribute to the improved wellbeing of 6000 Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) in the Mangochi district of Malawi. We increase access to essential services like health care and education by OVC in order for them to realize their full rights and potential. We do this by strengthening the care and support systems at household, community and district levels.

</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The direct target group of the project will be the 6 NOVOC member Community Based Organizations (CBOs) that directly work with the OVC caregivers and children. Their organizational and technical capacity will be strengthened so that they can effectively manage and deliver services to 6000 Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) by supporting them with Care Action Plans. The project will also benefit 120 OVC caregivers and vulnerable community members through livelihoods interventions. 


</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Mangochi district in the southern region of Malawi is one of the poorest parts of the country. It has a very high rate of HIV prevalence, which has contributed to high levels of orphanhood (12% of children under 18). Most orphans are living under absolute poverty and lack access to basic necessities. The Government of Malawi has identified six key areas of need for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC): food, clothing and shelter; healthcare; educational support; parental love; emotional and spiritual guidance; and vocational guidance. However, despite there being a number of government and non-government stakeholders offering a range of services at community, district and national level across these domains, 89% of OVC in Mangochi district receive no external support at all. This project considers the wider needs of these OVC by using the innovative approach of "Mkuta Mwana": putting the child and their family at the center of service provision through a Case Support System. </description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: In order to ensure the necessary care and support for 6000 OVCs, the following outputs and activities have been identified:

Output 1.  Adopted and functional Case Support System implemented by CBOs/NGOs who ultimately report to the District Social Welfare Office.

- The project will introduce a Case Support System, based on the successful Mkuta Mwana pilot in Salima district. NOVOC will run Training-of-trainer workshops for representatives from the 6 CBOs and the District Social Welfare Office (DSWO) in the Mkuta Mwana Case Support System, home visitor concept and the Volunteer Management Guidelines. CBOs will then be supported to train home visitors to develop Care Action Plans for OVC. Following the above training in volunteer management and support, NOVOC will support CBOs to work with volunteer groups, including facilitating regular cluster group meetings for volunteers to offer peer support and feedback the findings from the Child Action Plans. Volunteers will be encouraged to join the project’s economic empowerment activities such as Community Savings and Loans Associations to help improve the situation of their own households. 

Output 2. Functional referral system by and between OVC service providers established (CBO/NGO service providers, DSWO, Health, Education, Agriculture, Police and Judiciary)

- Create a referral network by mapping all OVC service providers in the district, produce a service directory, and work with the DSWO and other key stakeholders to facilitate quarterly referral network meetings, identifying one person from each organization as a focal person to coordinate referrals, monitor follow ups and participate in the quarterly meetings. 
 
Output 3.  OVC service providers (CBOs,NGO, DSWO and other government officials from health, education, agriculture, police, judiciary) have the capacity i.e knowledge, skills and attitudes to deliver services to 6000 OVC and their families through improved service delivery.

- CBOs will be supported to conduct an Organizational Self-Assessment to identify any capacity gaps, and conduct trainings to help fill those gaps. CBOs will also be supported to have Income Generating Activities of their choice based on the NOVOC livelihoods menu to enable them to mobilize resources to continue interventions beyond the duration of the project.  
- Health Surveillance Assistants and other relevant government field officers will be linked with with Community Based Childcare Centers (CBCCs) for growth monitoring, immunizations, provision of Vitamin A supplements, treatment of minor ailments, and promotion of good hygiene practices. Volunteers will also link children and caregivers to Hiv/AIDS Testing and Counseling (HTC) and support ART treatment uptake and adherence through local health facilities. 
- An assessment will be conducted of CBCCs in the target districts on quality of Early Childhood Development (ECD) services and number of trained caregivers, and ECD training will be provided through NOVOC partner Association of Early Childhood Education Malawi for 36 caregivers. CBOs will be supported to mobilize caregivers to access locally-sourced play materials such as tyre swings and musical instruments for CBCC. CBCCs will be further supported through IGAs and farm inputs for community gardens to provide food for children based on requests made by CBCC members CBOs will be supported to monitor the quality of services offered by CBCCs and report on progress. 
-Implement a Community Bursary Scheme through conducting an assessment to identify needy students not otherwise supported by any other person, institution or donor, liaising with the District Social Welfare Office (DSWO) and Bursary Committees in Mangochi. NOVOC will form a Community Bursary Scheme for OVC education support, using the inputs-payback model.
- Provide 1224 OVC with psychosocial support (PSS) to help them deal with trauma, through improving the provision of PSS in Children’s Corners in the target communities. The project will sensitize communities on the importance of a child’s emotional and social wellbeing, and train and support CBOs and Children’s Corner Caregivers (adults and youth members) to in turn train and support fellow caregivers to offer quality PSS to the children in their care. This train-the-trainer model will enable CBOs to replicate the intervention in other Children’s Corners.  
- Support 120 OVC households with farm inputs for food production. Upon harvest, the supported households pay back 3 bags of maize to the CBO, which are sold and the funds accrued to pay school fees for needy students identified within the community, through the Community Bursary Scheme. The intervention offers increased food security for households with OVCs and enables communities to support their needy children to access secondary education (210).  NOVOC, together with the DSWO, shall continue monitoring the households to ensure that they do not fall back, while also linking them to other social protection interventions by government such as social cash transfers, food for work and farm input subsidies to maximize the level of support they receive. NOVOC will further train 2 members per CBO to become Community Savings and Loans Associations (CSLA) agents and support them to establish and monitor CSLAs within their communities. 

Output 4: Government and OVC service providers addressing OVC needs based on sound policies and practices, guided by the Child Care, Protection and Justice Act 2010, Deceased Estates, the Constitution of the Republic of Malawi and the Social Support Policy

- Although there are a number of policies/laws relating to OVC care, support and protection, the implementation of these policies has been limited, leaving children vulnerable and open to exploitation. 
NOVOC will hold meetings with the 6 target CBOs to disseminate its Child Protection Policy and support members to develop a policy for their organization, assigning a Child Protection coordinator to act as a focal point for Child Protection policies and activities in each CBO. In addition to disseminating the relevant policies, this action will train and orient district stakeholders on the Child Care, Protection and Justice Act No. 22 of 2010, the Deceased Estates (Wills, Inheritance and Protection) Act No. 14 of 2011 etc to ensure they are familiar with current policy and their role in protecting OVC within the law. 


</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: An innovative approach has been developed to provide services to Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) in Malawi: Mkuta Mwana (Surrounding the Child). Mkuta Mwana is a child-centered approach to OVC service provision, making real and lasting changes in the lives of the most vulnerable children.  The Mkuta Mwana model was originally developed by Family Health International 360 (FHI360), funded by the Funders Collaborative For Children (FCFC), a coalition of Comic Relief, the Elton John Aids Foundation, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund and the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, and has been running in Salima district since 2008. Responsibility for running the project has now been handed to NOVOC, as the leading Malawian NGO for OVC care, support and protection. To date the project has supported over 12,000 children to access essential services across the domains of Livelihoods, Education, Social Welfare and Health.

The model is designed with sustainability at its heart. At household level, the home visitor volunteers are trained and supported to provide on-going support for the most vulnerable children. Volunteers are grouped into clusters in their local area, offering them a forum for skill-sharing, exchange and advice, helping to increase motivation and encourage volunteer retention. 

Furthermore, building the economic capacity of households will not only provide immediate improvements to the lives of the children in their care through increased access to disposable income to better meet material needs and promote food security, but is intended to increase OVC access to services in the medium- to long-term. Household poverty is a key barrier to OVC access to services, and evidence from similar interventions by NOVOC demonstrates that building the economic capacity of households increases OVC access to services. 

At community level, the technical capacity of Community Based Organizations (CBOs) is built to enable them to effectively manage interventions within their communities, and effectively support volunteers. They are also supported with income generating activities (such as maize mills) to help mobilize resources to sustain the activities, some of which (including the inputs-payback and goat-pass on schemes) are self-sustaining beyond the initial first year investment. By motivating and incentivizing the CBOs through training and building economic capacity, and giving them ownership of the interventions, NOVOC will promote greater sustainability and value for money. 

By strengthening the district referral network and promoting linkages between service providers (including government and NGOs), and building the capacity of key district stakeholders, the project leaves in place strong systems for managing the interventions beyond the initial funding for the activity. The District Social Wellfare Office (DSWO) will be responsible for the monitoring of the activities and so the action aims to foster closer ties between the office and the CBOs on the ground to help maintain high quality interventions. This will be overseen by a steering committee (through strengthening the existing District Aids Coordinating Committees).

    <title>Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction </title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Towards a more resilient Malawi</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Through the Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction Programme, Cordaid and CADECOM (the Catholic Development Commission of the Episcopal Conference of Malawi) work together to provide capacity building, increase resilience and disseminate knowledge on disaster risk reduction practices.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The overall objective of the Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction programme 2010 – 2012 is to contribute to strategies that enable 76 communities  most at risk to increase their resilience to disasters, thereby improving their livelihoods. </description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The direct target population consists of 6,840 households in the 76 communities, which are most vulnerable to hazards. These households have already been trained on the topic of CMDRR and climate change adaptation during previous programs. </description>
    <description type="1">Background: Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a population of 15.9 million people. Life expectancy is 39 years. 22% of the children are malnourished and 52% of the population lives below the absolute poverty line (less than 1USD per day). The economy relies heavily on agriculture, which accounts for 37% of the GDP. Since 2011, political unrest compromises de country’s stability. Tensions are mainly due to worsening fuel shortages, rising prices, high unemployment and poor governance. Additionally, Malawi faces a number of disasters, both natural and human-made, including floods, drought, landslides HIV/AIDS and gender inequalities. Moreover, the intensity and frequency of disasters has been increasing, due to climate change, population growth, urbanization and environmental degradation. These hazards are a threat to people’s livelihoods, endanger human and food security, damage infrastructure and hinder socio-economic growth and development.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The programme runs from January 2012 to December 2012. The programme has the following specific objectives:

1. To improve livelihoods of communities through small mitigation works, such as farmer trainings  on treadle pumps*, hygiene and sanitation practices, afforestation (tree planting), soil fertility  improvement, among other activities.
2. To facilitate monitoring, evaluation, learning and documentation of best livelihoods and other practices among ECM staff and communities.
3. To lobby and advocate for national Disaster Risk Reduction issues (national DRR policy and platform)
4. To increase and expand the knowledge in Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction and  Climate Change Adaptation exit strategies among staff and communities

The main activities involve: 

Result 1: Improved livelihoods of communities through small scale mitigative works.

- Promotion and scaling up of small scale irrigation
- Promotion and scaling up of Village Saving and Loans
- Promotion of crop diversification and storage 
- Promotion of drought tolerant crops
- Diversification of livelihoods opportunities
- Environmental Rehabilitation
- Promotion of use of safe portable water and sanitary facilities

Result 2: Improved resource mobilization and linkage through monitoring, learning and documentation and sharing of best practices.

- Capacity building of Episcopal Conference of Malawi (ECM) staff and communities

Result 3: Harmonize implementation of Disaster Risk Reduction among stakeholders within Malawi through the formation of national DRR forum.

- Lobbying and advocacy
- Conduct research of policy issues in close collaboration with Civil Society Network on Climate Change and Center for Social Concern.

Result 4: Established a national data bank for DRR monitoring and planning at partner level ( ECM, Diocese and Community)

- Participatory community monitoring and evaluation
- Documentation, coordination and evaluation.

*Treadle pump:  a human-powered suction pump that sits on top of a well and is used for irrigation. Through this water pumping mechanism, farmers reduce their dependence on rain fed irrigation and it helps them to improve  the irrigation of their small plots.
</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: Elements that contribute to the sustainability of our intervention involve the establishment of working groups, where members share resources and skills towards the achievement of a common goal. This is key to enhance the success and long term benefits of the project, as we engage communities at every stage and every level, from planning, building and financing to on – going project maintenance. Furthermore, the project implementation involves working with existing local structures, such as village committees, ensuring the sustainability of the intervention.  We believe that working through local communities, we are able to bring solutions tailored to their actual needs. Furthermore the use of the Community Managed Disaster Risk Approach places the beneficiary at the center of the process enabling them to prioritize hazards and develop appropriate measures to reduce the risk of the hazard becoming a disaster.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: The project has been completed. It has successfully managed to enhance the knowledge of community members on issues that affects them. Individuals are adopting Disaster Risk Approach in their daily lives. Coordination among community members has been strengthened, especially when dealing with issues that affected the community as a whole. Community based approach stimulated the incorporation of the community’s ideas into the project implementation. Village savings and loans groups performed smoothly. Beneficiaries became acquainted with financial practices such as borrowing and microfinance.</description>

    <title>Ongoing trainings for midwives</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle:  ICT based Continuous Professional Development (CPD)</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The country’s health facilities are often characterized with shortage of health workers manifested by high health worker/patient levels, namely 1 nurse per 3.680 people. We aim to build the capacity of 150 nurses and midwives using ICT-based CPD at six selected health centers in the country.  This project ensures the strengthening of the health service delivery.
</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The project bridges the information gap thereby ensuring access to updated knowledge, skills, competences and attitudes eventually strengthening health service delivery.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The project will target:
- 150 nurses/midwives who will follow the CPD: 25 nurses/midwives per focused health facility
- 6 health facilities that will benefit from increased skills of the nurses/midwives
The indirect beneficiaries are the people visiting the 6 health facilities and benefit from increased skills. 
</description>
    <description type="1">Background: The International Council of Nurses (ICN) as well the Nurses &amp; Midwives Council of Malawi put CPD as a compulsory requirement for renewal of nurses and midwives licenses every year. The requirement is aimed at equipping nurses and midwives with professional updates to improve knowledge, skills, attitudes, and competencies to achieve quality patient care. Both government through Ministry of Health and NONM jointly developed and endorsed CPD for nurses and midwives in Malawi since 2009. </description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The project plan consists of:
- Acquire equipment: 40 laptops, 2 desktops, wi-fi internet in order to equip the computer hubs (27.000 Euro)
- Support Health Centers with developed and operational guidelines in form of registers and clean physical environment through visits
- 48 sensitization workshops for District Health Management teams (12), Health Center management and Health Center committees (18), nurses/midwives (18) in the 6 health centers. (55.000 Euro)
- 4 content development workshops with Nurses &amp; Midwives Council, Nursing Directorate of the Ministry of Health (10.000 Euro)
- 3 monitoring, evaluation and supportive supervision visits per year to 6 project sites (25.000 Euro)
</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The nurses should be sensitized to use computers in order to get their CPD points. As they see the benefit of using ICT, they will benefit from saving time and costs to travel every time to get these CPD points.

If the ICT system will be set up, access to the digital sources can be financed by a small contribution of the nurses/midwives. This will be investigated in a later period.
</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: NONM is founded in 1979 as a non-governmental, professional organization which is responsible for the interest of the nurses and midwives in Malawi. Cordaid supports NONM since 2008 and NONM is showing good results since. </description>

Technical knowledge will be crucial in creating a win-win situation for flourishing communities in developing countries and Cordaid. It will enable communities to effectively improve their healthcare and it will enable Cordaid to qualify for assignments related to program implementation and technical assistance, providing a financial base for its operations and thus contribution to the establishment of Cordaid as a social entrepreneur.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: In the project plan, three main elements can be distinguished: (1) Direct technical support to programs, (2) research &amp; development and (3) representation &amp; learning. Crucial activities in these areas are:

Direct Support
•	Technical advice to improve programs in 16 different countries
•	Evaluations and reviews
•	Operational and high-level trainings and workshops for different target groups
•	Technical input in proposal writing

Research &amp; Development
•	Further development of the 3-delay model (This model explaines why pregnant women cannot access health care by distinguishing three levels: cultural and decision-making barriers, physical barriers like inaccessible roads, distance etc. and the quality of health care being offered)
•	Integration of RBF and youth services for SRHR/HIV
•	Development of demand side tools complementing current RBF programs (e.g. vouchers)
•	Development of a data management system, providing monitoring and evaluation information at various program levels
•	Research in relation to the equity mechanisms in RBF
•	Research in relation to the relation between RBF and Insurance
•	Impact studies

Representation &amp; Learning
•	Internal learning events to capture important lessons from program implementation
•	Presenting Cordaid’s lessons (National level, International conferences)
•	Gaining knowledge about contemporary thinking in relation to SRHR and RBF during conferences and high level courses 
•	Represent Cordaid in networks like Sharenet, Faith2action, COP, C4C
•	Development of technical content for the Cordaid website and other promotional material

    <description type="1">Sustainability: This program is mainly focusing on technical and institutional sustainability. The aim is to assist communities in setting up institutional frameworks for providing healthcare with sufficient checks and balances and to create and increase a critical body of technical expertise in developing countries. Achieved results will remain, even if donor funding is reduced. Furthermore, the program has a large policy influencing component aimed at changing attitudes of decision makers in relation to RBF of SRHR. </description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: Cordaid has extensive track record in RBF as well as SRHR. We have been involved in RBF ever since it was first introduced in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2001 and we are currently supporting RBF programs in Cameroun, DRC, Central African Republic, Sudan, Congo Brazzaville, Burundi, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Tanzania. For our SRHR programs we have been working together with various civil society organizations.</description>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Sharing knowledge about RBF and SRHR</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Technical knowhow is becoming increasingly important to improve health care in developing countries. This project is aiming to increase knowledge about Results Based Financing (RBF) and Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) for Cordaid staff and making existing knowledge more accessible for communities in developing countries.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: In RBF, Cordaid is capable of implementing large RBF programs and has specific knowledge on equity issues, community participation and demand side interventions. This track record allows us to provide tailor made trainings and assist partners in developing strategies in relation to Universal Health Coverage. In SRHR we provide specific knowledge on the 3-delay model and the role of youths and church organisations. This project aims to expand this knowledge by creating an evidence base, which is supported by reliable and easily accessible operational data.</description>

    <title>Improved maternal health using ICT</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Timely referral, improved reporting and awarenessraising 

</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The project will concentrate on the catchment area of Koche Health center in Mangochi Diocese, which consists of 22 villages with a population of 45,901, 10,558 women of child bearing age, 528 expected pregnancies, and 2.294 children under 1 year.  The approad is integrated, including mobile phones which will be used for improved reporting, reminders for ANC-visits and referral.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: •	To  increase referral of pregnant mothers between community and Koche Health Center for delivery from 61% to 90%  by 2014
•	To  increase attendance of antenatal care visits from the targeted project area at Koche Health Center from 1 to 4 visits per pregnant mother.
•	To promote active involvement of men and community leaders on maternal and infant care by 2014
</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: Direct target group 700 pregnant women and their babies.
Indirect target group: 10558 women of child bearing age.
In all the 22 villages, one volunteer and one HSA per village.
Koche Health Centre staff.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: In Mangochi Diocese, as is the case in Malawi as a whole, high maternal mortality is a result of long distance to health facility, inadequate skilled  human resource resulting into poor case management, poor data management, inadequate information in the community on the importance of ANC, poor communication between the community and the health facility therefore resulting into delayed referrals. Direct causes of maternal deaths include malaria, sepsis, eclampsia/pre-eclampsia, haemorrhage, mothers that are too young, anaemia, Hiv and Aids.  The government encourages every woman to report for antenatal care clinic within the first trimester but only 18% of pregnant women do so at Koche Health Centre because of long distance to the health centre and only 61% report for delivery.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: To improve referral of pregnant mothers between community and Koche health centre for delivery from.61% to 90%

	Conduct 4 sessions for HSAs, TBAs and safe motherhood committees on safe motherhood
	Renovation of guardian shelter
	Subsidizing transport and delivery  for needy pregnant women
	Procure ambulance bicycles
	Procure soft and hard ware (15 cell phones, 15 solar chargers, 3 tablets , 2 computer’s, 1 internet dongle
	Conduct 3 usage trainings for safe motherhood committees, HSAs, TBAs and health facility staff
	Conduct 21 computer literacy training for safe motherhood committees, HSAs and health facility staff.

To improve attendance of antenatal care visits from targeted project area at Koche health centre from 1 to 4 
	Conduct 72outreach clinics
	Renovation of 43 ANC outreach clinics
	Renovate Koche health centre guardian shelter

To promote active involvement of men and community leaders on maternal and infant care by 2014 

	Conduct 24 dialogue sessions on maternal issues
	Conduct 6 advocacy meetings
	Develop helpful safe motherhood rips
	Conduct 8 stakeholders sensitization meetings
	Establishing male safe motherhood committees (Male Champions)

    <description type="1">Sustainability: Solar chargers will be in the community, which will also be used to generate funds for future maintenance of the phones and phone airtime.  HSAs are employed by government which ensures of regular income therefore can easily buy airtime. Charging can also be done at HSAs houses where they usually charge their own phones. Koche health centre is financially better, which reassures us of computers being maintained when need arise and the management has been trying to have this system in place therefore due to this willingness, they will make sure that the system is well sustained.

</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: Since end 2011 an ICT project has been implemented. Initially it was tuned towards HBC-workers at the moment it has turned more to women's health.  </description>

    <title>Strong livelihoods </title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Strong livelihoods through DRR and farmer entrepreneurship</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: In St. Thereza and St. Joesph parishes of Mzuzu diocese 4000 smallholder farmers and their families will improve their livelihood. By learning better agriculutral practises, participating in saving and loaning clubs, investing in different crops and trades and rehabilitating their environment they will be enabled to cope with hazards.  </description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The project will realise significant increase in household income and food security of the 4000 farmer families. In this way resilience at household and community level will improve. Specific objectives are to improve technical and entrepreneurial skills of the farmers and to implement community disaster risk reduction plans.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The traget group consists of 4000 smallholder farmer households in two parishes of Mzuzu diocese. Total number of benefiaries is 20000.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Malawi regularly faces disasters, such as floods, drought, landslides and HIV/AIDS. The intensity and frequency of disasters are increasing, due to climate change, population growth, urbanisation and environmental degradation. These hazards are a threat to people’s livelihoods, endanger human and food security, damage infrastructure and hinder socio-economic growth and development.  A combination of community managed disaster risk reduction and promotion of agricultural entrepreneurship helps to reduce the vulnerability of communities at risk and to increased their capacity to absorb shocks and sustain their livelihoods. Community organisations such as civil protection committees, savings and loan clubs and farmer cooperatives themselves are responsible for implementation of their plans, making use of local resources, market access and service providers and cooperating with relevant partners, such as Cadecom Mzuzu, local government and local traders or enterprises. 


 </description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: Under the three main objectives several activiteis will be conducted in the first year:

Objective 1: to improve entrepreneurship skills among 4000 households:
-Training of community facilitators
-forming and training of new farmer clubs
-revitalization of old, already existing farmer clubs
-facilitating formation  of a cooperative in Nkhatabay district
-training cooperative committees and club leaders in cooperative leadership and governance
-training of Cadecom staff and farmers on value chain analysis
-conducting value chain analysis for selected crops
-training on different areas of agribusiness and entrepreneurial skills
-training beneficiaries on marketing skills and market research
-training on post harves handling
-linking farmer clubs and cooperatives to existing markets
-promotion of village savings and loan associations
-sensitization meetings on use and maintenance of small machinery

Objective 2: to facilitate development and implementation of disaster risk mitigation plans for communities
For Nkhatabay:
-management of community tree nurseries
-planting and managing trees in Lweya catchment area
-contstructing protective bunds and ridges
-production of early warning system manual
For Mzimba:
-conduting DRR asessments
-promotion of corp diversification and drought tolerant crops
-diversification of livelihood opportuniteis
-environmental rehabilitation
--contruction protective bunds and ridges
-management of community tree nurseries
-planting and managing trees

Objective 3: to facilitate monitoring, learning and documentation of best practises among staff and communitie
-trainig of community facilitators, creating database on best practises, disseminating best practises and IEC materials, exchange visits and field days, develop case studies and documentaries.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: Elements that make our project sustainable are the continuous emphasis on the capacity building of vulnerable communities. We believe that people know best how to solve their own problems, and the joint efforts aim at bringing tailored solutions to the needs of the community. In addition food security and income of smallholder farmers is strengthened through the use of sustainable approaches such as the promotion of irrigation and diversification of food crops and access to markets. This agricultural approach contributes to the efficient and balanced production of major crops, while considering soil fertility and climatic conditions. Furthermore, increased community participation on disaster risk reduction measures, enhances community ownership. For a project to be truly successful, the community members must be viewed and view themselves as owners of the project. Furthermore, communities are engaged at every stage of the project implementation, this ensures the adoption and proper dissemination of capacities and knowledge that equips them with skills and strategies to handle their own projects.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: In Mzimba district (where St. Thereza parish is located) Cadecom Mzuzu has implemented a three year project on agricultural production, market development and formation of a farmer cooperative. In Nkhatabay district (where St. Joseph parish is located) a community managed flood risk reduction project was implemented. In the current project the communities in the two parishes will learn from each others experiences. It is expected that integration of the two approaches will increase food security and community resilience.</description>

    <title>Promotion of Women's Health Rights</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Demanding sexual and reproductive health rights</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The main aim of this project is to enhance the capacity of women to demand fulfillment of their sexual and reproductive health rights in order to promote safe motherhood. In addition, the project will also seek to promote sexual and reproductive health rights of People Living with AIDS especially women.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: To enhance the capacity of women in Zomba and Lilongwe rural in demanding the fulfillment of their sexual and reproductive health rights by 2012</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The direct target group is 3500 women and 2500 men, 1000 adolescents, 20 women leaders that are leading groups of fellow women living with AIDS, 30 law enforcers, 156 traditional leaders, 40 health workers and 50 stakeholders working at community and district level. </description>
    <description type="1">Background: The Malawi Government’s commitment to the promotion of sexual and reproductive rights is expressed in the 2002 Reproductive Health Policy (Government of Malawi 2002). Despite such commitment, the reality on the ground indicate that a majority of women and youths in Malawi do not enjoy their sexual and reproductive health rights. More than half of the women have had a child by the time they reach age 20, many of these pregnancies are unplanned and unwanted. Approximately one third of all maternal deaths are due to unsafe abortions amongst teenage girls. Teenage pregnancy is a serious problem, and maternal mortality remains extremely high. Despite these problems, adolescents are viewed as a healthy population and accorded low priority in delivery of Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH) services and the current SRH services do not fully address their needs and are not youth friendly. In light of this, there is need to develop SRH programs that are responsive to adolescents needs.

    <description type="1">Sustainability: The creation of the “safe motherhood groups” which will be accountable to the village development committees is one of the ways to ensure sustainability of the project on the ground. Thus the groups would have been empowered on how to address sexual and reproductive health rights problems within their communities As the project goes towards the end, Women’s Legal Resources Centre (WOLREC) will be doing participatory assessments with the groups in order to identify their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Together with the groups, WOLREC will identify how such weaknesses, threats should be addressed and on the other hand how the strengths and opportunities can be build on in order to build up strong groups. Towards the end of the project, these groups will be handed over to Ministry of Gender so that they can incorporate the groups as part of their on-going program on women empowerment. The Ministry already has a program which seeks to empower women through creation of such structures.

In addition, WOLREC will also ensure availability of critical information on sexual and reproductive health rights through strengthening of the resource centers that are found in the two traditional authorities.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: Women’s Legal Resources Centre (WOLREC) is a women’s rights organization based in Blantyre, Malawi. WOLREC got registered in 2006.

    <title>Supporting farmers in disaster risk reduction</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: A Savings &amp; Credit program to strengthen farmers response to face disasters</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: A Self Help Assistance Program (ASAP) is an organization which has set up a self-help program promoting the establishment of VSL, Village Savings and Lending Associations. Cordaid (Financial Services) is supporting this project that reaches out to remote villages since 2009 and is starting a new phase: Scaling up Sustainable Access to Financial services.
</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: Malawi, especially the southern region, can be characterized as vulnerable to droughts and floods. Frequently droughts or floods cause loss of harvest in places where the food security is already a problem. By organizing and supporting Village Savings and Loans Associations, ASAP and Cordaid create opportunities for households to respond actively and effectively to natural and handmade hazards. Also, a we strive with a more integral approach for  better results from agriculture through access to financial services and by improved protection measures to mitigate the consequences of disasters.
</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The project is going to be mainstreamed in ASAP’s Village Savings and Lending project for 2012-2013 VSL Scale Up, Sustainable Access to Financial Services (SAFE); which is mainly targeting  2700 project beneficiaries(1890women and men 810 men) to economically empower their households with access to savings, credit, business capital and enterprise development.
The project will directly build the capacity of 70 project participants (30 Villages Agents and 40 women participating in VSL activities).</description>
    <description type="1">Background: A Self Help Assistance Program (ASAP) is a charitable company limited by guarantee. It was registered in 2008 under the Malawi company act, 1984; and was registered as a charity organization with the Council for Non-Governmental organization in Malawi (CONGOMA) in the same year. The mission of ASAP is, ‘ To build self-reliance among the poorest communities through community led sustainable initiatives that empowers women and men, and mobilize local resources to fulfill basic social and economic rights of the people in Malawi’.

ASAP enabled the poor and vulnerable households to develop economic mechanisms for coping with hazards and natural disasters through access to cash savings and increased income, to access foods at the local markets. ASAP has observed that households participatin are still vulnerable to natural and manmade hazards such as climate change, floods, drought and market failures.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: A Self Help Assistance Program ASAP intends to pilot a project on community managed disaster risk reduction and farming as a business in several districts in Malawi. The project will be implemented in villages which are heavily affected by drought and Floods especially those along Risumbwi River and Shire River respectively.  The focus of this project is to build the capacity of ASAP’s Staff and local structures on how to facilitate and mainstream Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction and Farming as a Business in communities participating in village savings and lending activities.

ASAP staff will undergo an intensive training on CMDRR and Farming as a Business engaging highly skilled and experienced personnel from CADECOM and NASFAM. The entire program team of ASAP will undergo this training. These are; 1) Program Manager, 2) Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Officer, 3) 2 VSL Field Officer, 4) 1 Field Officer on CMDRR and Farming as a Business.  This team will proceed to train Village Agents, Women and Village Civil Protection Committees on the same methodology. These local structures will be provided a Training of Trainers training on CMDRR and Farming as a Business with serious participation of ASAP’s senior management and wherever gaps are noted ASAP will engage experienced external facilitators to  beef up the ASAP’s training team.    

Based on the learning from the community, ASAP will work with local structures: Village Agents, Civil Protection committees at the village level and other relevant structures to help the community go through a CMDRR assessment following the steps outlined below:   
1. Site Entry and Rapport Building 
2. Participatory Community Risk Assessments 
3. Community Hazard Assessment 
4. Community Vulnerability Assessment 
5. Community Capacity Assessment 
6. Identification of Priority Groups 
8. Feedback /validation of results of Community Risk Analysis 
9. Further analysis of the priority problem/need/ aspiration 
10. Organization of the risk reduction group 
11. Planning of the risk reduction 
</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The VSL project has increased households income, enabled growth of rural enterprise activities through access to soft loans and consequent business capital.  In addition, VSL has enabled the poor and vulnerable households to develop economic mechanism for coping with hazards and natural disasters such as floods and drought through access to cash savings and increased income which make it possible for these households to access foods at the local markets. However this, ASAP has observed that households participating in VSL and enterprise projects  are still vulnerable to natural and manmade hazards such as climate change, floods, drought and market failures hence the imperative to mainstream/include Community Managed Disaster Risk reduction activities in the VSL and enterprise projects. This is going to build synergy effects on the livelihoods capacity of rural households especially those currently participating in the VSL and enterprise activities.</description>

    <title>Reproductive health services for girls</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Access to Family Planning with a focus on youth</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Banja La Mtsogolo (BLM) operates a national program that provides reproductive health services through a network comprised of clinics, outreach teams, community health workers, and partnerships in the private sector. The underlying program seeks to address the unmet need for Family Planning (FP) in Nkhotakota District and to expand access to FP among adolescent girls.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The key objectives of the proposed Cordaid program include:
- Increasing access to high quality Family Planning (FP) services including long-acting and permanent methods through direct service provision thereby reducing unmet need for FP, reducing unwanted pregnancies, and reducing maternal mortality and morbidity for 50.000 FP clients.
- Increased awareness and knowledge of FP and Sexual and Reproductive Health services at the individual, household and community levels
- Strengthen both public and private healthcare service providers to ensure long-term availability of FP.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The target group is 50.000 family planning clients. </description>
    <description type="1">Background: Malawi has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa with 675 deaths per 100.000 live births and remains off-track to achieving Millennium Development Goal 5 by 2015. A major underlying cause is the unmet need for contraception of 26.1%, leading to avoidable pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality associated to unplanned births and unsafe abortion. This situation is both unacceptable and preventable.  </description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The main activities are:
Activity 1. Provide Family Planning (FP) and other Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) services through BLM's outreach program. 
- A full range of FP services are provided, with an emphasis on where short-term methods are already available. These include: LAPM (Long Acting and Permanent Methods)

Activity 2. A health markets approach to increase private sector delivery of FP through BLM clinics, BlueStar Healthcare Network and product social marketing.
- In addition to the franchised network, we will continue to work with healthcare product wholesalers and retailers to increase access to male condoms, pregnancy test kits and emergency contraception through BLM’s social marketing program.
 
Activity 3. Ensure access to FP and SRH services and referrals through BLM’s network of community-based Reproductive Health Assistants.
- Training and deploying three Youth Reproductive Health Assistants.
- Increase the total number of Reproductive Health Assistants trained in FP counseling, referral and service delivery.

Activity 4. Increasing youth access to FP service delivery through all service channels.
- This will include training in the national Youth Friendly Health Services curriculum as well as supportive supervision visits by BLM’s youth team to encourage use of youth friendly techniques. 
- This will also involve coordination with the National Youth Council of Malawi to support accreditation of these facilities as youth friendly delivery points. 

Activity 5. Support the further development and implementation of an evidence-based Behavior Change Communication strategy.
- Additional resources through the Cordaid program will enable BLM to undertake ambitious communications activities to diversify the method mix in Malawi, with a focus on increasing uptake of LAPMs and increasing access to FP for youth.
- We will support low-cost national level mass communications via radio and with the production of leaflets and information, education and communications materials.

Activity 6. Training and mentoring of healthcare workers in the delivery of FP services with particular focus on LAPMs (in line with national standards).
- BLM will undertake in-service training in FP, general FP training, LAPM, for Ministry of Health mentorship sites, BlueStar Healthcare Network providers, for community level distributors, and for staff employed in direct service delivery in BLM clinics and outreach teams.
- Over the course of program implementation, BLM will provide in-service training to over 65 healthcare workers with over 15 trained on LAPMs in Nkhotakota District.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: BLM seeks to address unmet need for family planning in Nkhotakota District and to expand access to contraception among adolescent girls. Cordaid investment in the BLM program will help support a total market intervention that leverages all of BLM’s service channels for the first time in this district to provide service access for the next two years and build a sustainable platform for long-term access to essential reproductive health services.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: BLM was established by Marie Stopes International (MSI) in 1987 and is now a senior partner of the MSI Global Partnership. The organization’s mission is to bring private sector excellence to bear in the delivery of reproductive health services to improve quality and equity. In 2009 BLM began its second program of work (POW) 2009-2015. The goal of this POW is to reduce maternal mortality and rapid population growth, and combat HIV/AIDS in Malawi and has joint support from different organizations.</description>

    <title>farming and risk reduction</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: integration of farmer entrepreneurship and disaster risk reduction</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: To increase farmers' sustainablity and economic benefits it is important to offer services aimed at setting up feasible and profitable agricultural  activities. This project will train local trainers to offer these kind of services to farmers. </description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: Staff of Cadecom Karonga need new skills and knowledge to be able to sustain and improve people's livelihoods, not only by reducing disaster risks but also by increasing their income and strengthening their economic base.  Specific indicated areas for new skills and knwledge are: bee keeping, banana production, cooperative development, agricultural entrepreneurship and organic farming.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: Rural communities in Karango with whom Cadecom Karango is working.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: The Catholic Development Commission (Cadecom) of Karonga diocese aims to integrate farming as a business in their program on flood risk reduction, as to decrease the risk that floods destroy the crops in the field and thus the income of the farmers. Cadecom Karonga is currently implementing a Community Management Disaster Risk Reduction project called Community Managed Flood Risk Reduction Project in Karonga District. The project strted in 2011 and is now its third year. Its major component is river bank protection. Implementation of the project is on track. In order to ensure sustainability of the project by the communities Cadecom Karonga is proposing an integrated river catchment and river bank managementproject. The main focus will be on empowering the local communities within the project areas with the necessary knowledge and skills to use natural resources in a way that helps them to improve their household food security and income without degrading the environment.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The project wants to improve and integrate bee keeping and banana production as well as processing and marketing of the products from these economic activities. In this way community members see the benefits of taking care and properly managing their natural resources.
Staff members of Cadecom Karonga and its partners will implement this. However, they do not have the adequate capacity to do this effectively and efficiently. This project will therefore  build the capacity of its staff in the following areas:
-	Bee keeping, honey processing, packaging and marketing
-	Banana production, handling, packaging and marketing
- Setting up Associations/Cooperatives
- Business management and entrepreneurship
- Organic farming and certification of organic foods

    <title>Food, seeds and planting material support</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: A relief food assistance &amp; agriculture recovery project in Nsanje district</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: This programme has been conceived in response to the vulnerability and food security report by the Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC, 2013) which has indicated that a large population will miss their food entitlements if no action will be taken. Cordaid and Cadecom aim to save and protect livelihoods of approximately 640 households (approx 3,520 people) in Nsanje district in Malawi. </description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: - To reduce the period of food insecurity amongst 640 households (approx 3,520 people) in Nsanje Districts, Malawi from 3 months to 0 and improve their food consumption
- To improve the capacity of 310 households (approximately 1,705 people) to produce sufficient food through provision of seeds/planting materials through small scale irrigation
- To build the capacity of approx 1,705 people, 50 members of the District Civil Protection Committees, and 10 Cadecom staff in Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction (CMDRR) and Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation, and/or handling emergencies.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: In this project, we will target 640 households (approximately 3,520 people) in Mlolo (Nsanje District) for food transfer, 310 households (approximately 1,705 people) with agricultural inputs – seeds/planting materials- and capacity building in CMDRR and Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation for resilient building. In addition, 10 CADECOM staff and 50 members of the District Civil Protection Committees will be targeted with capacity building initiatives in handling emergencies.


</description>
    <description type="1">Background: This programme has been conceived in response to the vulnerability and food security report by the Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC, 2013) which has indicated that a total population of 1,855,183 in 24 out of 29 Districts in Malawi will miss their food entitlements during the 2013/2014 consumption year if no action will be taken by the humanitarian actors (MVAC, 2013 report released in November, 2013). 
The Malawi Drought Response and Recovery Project in Nsanje Districts will target 640 households affected by the 2013/2014 drought situation whose food consumption has been (will be) affected during the 2013/2014 consumption year. The project interventions will only target areas and households not benefiting from the World Food Programme coordinated MVAC 2013/2014 Response Project (due to limited financial sources of their donors).

</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The project consists of three main components:
- Targeted food distribution;
- Promotion of crop diversification through provision of seeds/planting materials; and
- Capacity building.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The Catholic Development Commission in Malawi (CADECOM); the relief and development arm of the Episcopal Conference of Malawi (ECM) will implement the project in Nsanje district in close collaboration with the Department of Disaster Management Affairs, District Councils and other humanitarian actors working in the three Districts. The same project intervention is also developed for two other districts (Dedza and Phalombe) and proposed to other donors. It contributes to a wider humanitarian response, in coordination with the World Food Programme.

The following measures will be undertaken in order to safeguard an adequate exit:
- Capacity building of target population will be one strategy of exiting the project as the people will have the required knowledge, skills and attitude in humanitarian programming and community managed disaster risk reduction.
- The inclusion of Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction will ensure that the people execute strategies which are going to contribute towards building their resilience to hazards and disasters such as dry spells and floods after the end of the project. 
- Use of committees i.e. village relief committees, village development committees, village civil protection committees will ensure project interventions towards resilient building will continue after June, 2014
- Capacity building of members of the District Civil Protection Committees in Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction, Spheres Project, Logistics will ensure government continued follow up on the project after closer of the same as government will always be there and CADECOM   will complement government effort 
- CADECOM will hand over any project interventions left after June, 2014 to the government through District Councils to ensure continued support and monitoring of the interventions

    <title>Basic needs and climate change advocacy</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Effects of poverty and climate change on food security of rural population</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The rural basic needs basket is a research tool that generates evidence on food security in households and social service delivery, in 10 communities in 4 districts of Malawi. It depicts aspects of rural livelihoods, nutritional deficiencies and social service delivery, and is being used in awareness campaigns and lobby with government on reducing poverty and effects of climate change on poverty.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The Centre of Social Concern promotes social justice for all people with a preferential option for the poor. The Centre engages with selected communities in four districts. The quarterly Rural Basic Needs Basket (RBNB) data collection among 200 households provides evidence on poverty and effects of climate change on poverty. The Centre uses these results for awareness campaigns to change people's behavior and lobby initiatives to influence national policies on improving rural livelihoods and food security.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The project targets 10 communities in 4 districts. In the Rural Basic Needs Basket research the number of households collecting data increases from 100 to 200 in these 10 communities. In each of these communities a RBNB group will be formed. The project will train 150 women of these groups and 30 local faith group leaders on climate advocacy skills.
Other target groups are audience of radio programs on climate change, made by the Centre, and politicians at district and national levels.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Malawi belongs to the 20 poorest countries of the world, with almost 75 percent of the people living below the absolute poverty line. About 90 percent of the rural population is smallholder farmers, cultivating fragmented landholdings with mostly low yields. Climate change is showing its challenges with greater weather extremes of heat waves, unpredictable rains and droughts. The most common shocks are crop failures and increases in food prices. Also the HIV/Aids epidemic, affecting almost 12 percent of the total population, has a huge impact on people's livelihoods. Civil society organizations can make a meaningful contribution to inform and influence government policies or supporting communities directly to improve living conditions.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The project will expand its monthly Rural Basket Needs Basket (RBNB) data collection from 100 to 200 households.  In 5 out of the 10 communities where the Centre works, quarterly surveys on the quality of social services delivery will continue. Reports on these exercise are presented to the press, government agencies, politicians and other civil society organisations to inform them and to engage them in livelihood related polices and advocacy. Due to the ever increasing impact of climate change, the project will raise awareness and knowledge on the link between food insecurity, rural livelihoods and weather related shocks. Therefore, the Centre will form community RBNB groups and train local women and faith group leaders. The aim is to increase communities' understanding on resilience in climate change and engage community representatives in climate change advocacy. In this way policy makers become aware of the negative effects of climate change on the agricultural livelihoods of the poor and adopt policies that focus on positive measures for climate change adaptation.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: Understanding effects of climate change and evidence based research help in national and district level policy changes that benefit the poor and improve their livelihoods and food security.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: The Rural Basic Needs Basket research started two years ago and will be continued to generate evidence on food security in households and social service provision in communities. Integrating the effects of climate change in the research is a new element, but highly relevant, now that weather extremes occur more frequently and create deeper shocks to the poor rural population.</description>

    <title>SMS to improve reproductive health care</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Improving access and quality of reproductive health services through SMS</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The project seeks to improve the quality and accessibility to reproductive health service at community level by providing an effective and reliable timely communication, data recording, analysis and evaluation system. High quality data will help in effective program evaluation and decision making thereby bringing in suitable and effective interventions where needed.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The project seeks to explore the potential of using mobile phones to improve maternal and child health services by enriching specific target audience  with maternal health information as well as providing a better effective and fast mode of communication and reporting between community based maternal and child health (MCH) structures and the hospital. The target area is Traditional Authority Mazengera, Traditional Authority (T/A) Chitekwere and Traditional Authority Kalumbu. </description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The target groups are:
Family Planning clients: 9.571 in a year
Antenatal clients: 6.170 in a year
Postnatal care clients: 7.350 in a year</description>
    <description type="1">Background: The Malawi national demographic and health survey conducted in 2010 reports that 56% of pregnant women in the rural areas do not achieve the recommended 4 visits to antenatal clinic (ANC) for check-up. This is in contrast to 50% of pregnant women who also miss out on the recommended four antenatal visits in urban areas. The higher percentage of missing out in rural areas has been attributed to a number of factors including lack of adequate and appropriate knowledge for antenatal care, poor communication between community health structures and the hospital, long distances to health centers and lack of appropriate transport means to get to the hospital. </description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: 1.	Women’s groups. 
Nkhoma Hospital public health department has been implementing a safe motherhood program with one of the components being women empowerment with knowledge and decision making as regards maternal issues. The project which runs in three Traditional Authorities (T/A) namely  Mazengera, Chitekwere and Kalumbu has seen about 300 safe motherhood women’s groups established. T/A Mazengera has a total of one hundred and ten women’s groups while T/A Chitekwere has a total of one hundred women’s groups. T/A Kalumbu has the remaining 100 women's groups. The idea behind women's groups is to equip women with information about their reproductive health and enable them identify, discuss and strategize on solutions to reproductive health problems or issues within their local setting. For every 10 women's groups in a close area, there is one facilitator allocated to supervise/facilitate the ten groups. Thus for the 300 women's groups, there are 31 facilitators. Each group also has its leadership responsible for the running of the group. On average, each group has thirty members, translating the membership of all the groups to around 8500. The facilitators whose role is to initiate and facilitate maternal and child health discussions, are literate women selected from the community and then trained in maternal and child health issues. They record meeting proceedings, respond to arising issues during meetings and report on monthly basis to the hospital. For instance, they record the number of women in attendance at a meeting, the topic of discussion, the discussion minutes (including questions and answers). They also take aboard issues the community needs special address by hospital personnel to the hospital, arrange with hospital staff to address special meetings and also record and report pregnancies in their community and the outcomes of the pregnancies. 
When there is a case requiring an ambulance from the hospital, they communicate with the hospital requesting the same. They liaise with local leaders on by laws guiding maternal and reproductive health issues and report any breaking of the bylaws to the local leaders. Community by laws are rules and regulations set forth and agreed by members of the particular community and their leaders with respect to specific phenomena or issue and apply to the members of that particular community. Community leaders are mandated by government to formulate and follow such bylaws so long as they are agreed upon and promote the good of the community. For instance, most communities (villages) in Nkhoma agreed that all pregnant women must deliver at a health facility and not at home or at a traditional birth attendant. To enforce this by law, any woman who delivers elsewhere apart from a health facility is punished by paying a goat to the local chief. Similarly, any Traditional Birth attendant found to be conducting deliveries in the community is punished by also paying a goat and some money to the local chief.   The facilitators and the leaders of the women's groups are key to knowledge acquisition, pregnancy cases follow ups, and bridging the hospital personnel and the community as well as the local leaders with the community.
All communication and reporting is however paper based  and in some cases they rely on availability of individuals going to the hospital to pass on any messages they would like to pass to the hospital. This is ineffective and leads to delays and missing information in most cases. Providing the facilitators and the leaders of the women's groups with a better, more reliable, fast and effective mode of communication and reporting by means of mobile phones may improve the performance of the women's groups and in the long term improve the maternal and child health status in the community.

2.	Key informants.
The other existing structure at community level is the key informants. Key informants (KI) are community volunteers who work in their respective community in informing health workers about health issues in general and safe motherhood in particular. They gather monthly information on number of pregnant women, number of deliveries, maternal deaths, and place of delivery, neonatal deaths and antenatal attendance. They also act as advisors to families on issues of safe motherhood. By the end of every month they send their reports to the data manager at Nkhoma Hospital. They also report their findings and any relevant issues to their local leaders. There are a total of two hundred and twelve key informants in the community reporting to Nkhoma hospital. The criterion of selection is any literate male or female who is accepted by their local community with guidance of Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs). In areas where there are women's groups, the key informants work hand in hand with the leaders and facilitators of the women's groups for collaborative efforts since they aim at achieving the same goal –reducing maternal and neonatal mortality. 
The key informants are embedded to the Area Development Committee (ADC) for collaboration purposes with other groups in the community and also for sustainability purposes. They record their information and compile their reports in paper form and subsequently hand deliver the reports to the data manager or wait for ADC meetings to hand in their reports to representatives from the hospital. 
In terms of communication, the key informants depend on the HSAs to pass on messages to the hospital or often times use their phones (for those who have) to communicate with the hospital. This delays communication and reporting and results into missing or poor quality reports reaching the hospital. The situation could be improved if the key informants were given a better means of communication and reporting as suggested with the women's groups. Also the key informants and HSA's could be provided with phones with specific applications to register pregnant women, make follow ups and record danger signs and refer them to the hospital as may be required.
 
3.	Health surveillance assistants
The third category of community structures vital in maternal and child health are the health surveillance assistants (HSAs). These are employed by the government and act as a bridge between the community and the hospitals. They look into general as well as specific health issues in the community, conduct village clinics and act as a means of communication between the community structures and the hospital as they frequently visit the hospital. There are one hundred and thirty seven HSAs around Nkhoma catchment area. HSA's help in the compilation of reports in almost all the community health structures and carry the reports to the right personnel at the hospital. 
HSA's are key in reporting outbreaks and handling numerous health issues at the community. They are seen as “village doctors” as they are also often responsible in administering vaccines and running village clinics.  Long as the distances may be from where they stay to the hospital, they are somehow forced to travel to the hospital from time to time to pass on messages between the two sides, hospital and community. The commendable work of HSA's in maternal and child health and indeed other health issues could be enhanced and improved by providing them with mobile phones for instant communication and also reporting. In such a case, most of the health care communication concerns could be eased.

4.	Safe motherhood committees.  
The government of Malawi abolished the works of the Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) due to their lack of skills and appropriate materials needed when conducting deliveries, causing unnecessary or avoidable maternal and neonatal deaths. The initial and recommended idea by government was that TBAs should stop conducting deliveries and instead they should just help direct pregnant women due for delivery to the hospital. However, it was observed that some TBAs defied this order and would continue with deliveries when approached by pregnant women due for delivery. Local leaders around Nkhoma hospital formulated bylaws abolishing any work of TBAs including that of directing to the hospital. Instead, the local communities formed what are called “Safe Motherhood Committees” which comprises several elected people to manage safe motherhood resources such as bicycle ambulances and to facilitate the sending of expectant women due for labor to the hospital. There are a total of sixty eight safe motherhood committees in T/A Mazengera and T/A Chitekwere, representing the main villages in the two TAs. They do report to the village heads as well as the hospital on monthly basis. They are also responsible for following up on maternal and neonatal deaths in collaboration with the hospital staff. This could be death that occurred at the hospital or the community. For effective communication and reporting, equipping them with mobile phones for use in communicating and reporting is not only a good  idea that will improve their work but also a motivation to them. 

5.	Community based distribution agents. (CBDAs)
Community based distribution agents are people (men and women) who distribute family planning methods to men and women of child bearing age in the community. The family planning methods that they make available to the community are those that do not require special hospital equipment. They are trained by the hospital’s family planning unit and are monitored by the same. They also report back to the family planning unit at the hospital and also at the Area Development Committee (ADC). There are a total of 50 CBDAs in the target area. Their work could be made easier if they were provided with mobile phones to register clients on family planning, follow up and record if necessary and also report to the hospital electronically. Statistics show that only 17% of women in the child bearing age are on contraceptives. The statistics could be higher if all people accessing family planning methods through other means could also be recorded. For instance, many people collect condoms from ART, HTC and other places not necessarily as a family planning method but eventually end up practicing family planning when they use the condoms. 

With these efforts in place, it is still estimated that 73% of pregnant women deliver at health facility leaving 27% delivering at home or along the way to the hospital</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: In terms of sustainability, communities are empowered and trained such that continuation is possible after the project phases out.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: The first year of the project was devoted to Home Based Care (HBC) program with an aim of improving quality and access to HBC services through provision of effective and real time communication and reporting using mobile phones. The project is in its implementation phase for year one. In year two, expected to start in December 2012, we plan to take the same project into women’s health or reproductive and child health.</description>

    <title>Awareness on Sexual Reproductive Health </title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Projects on delay of marriage and pregnancy </description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Early sexual debut and pregnancy contribute to a lot of problems in reproductive health among adolescent girls in Malawi. Traditional and cultural practices, beliefs and negative attitudes limit adolescent girls from utilizing reproductive health services denying them from enjoying their rights. Proposed project will work on delay of marriage and pregnancy with different approaches.
</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: By 2015
1.	Increase by 60% knowledge and life skills on adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health &amp; Rights (SRHR) among poor and marginalized rural adolescent girls by 60%. 
2.	Reduce by 50% school dropout due to early marriage and early pregnancy. 
3.	To influence 60 local leaders to put in place modified cultural practices and beliefs that will reduce violence against girls. 
4.	20 schools are free from violence against girls and cases of gender based violence are reduced to 0. 
5.	All the 10 health centers become accessible for youth utilizing SRH information and services available.  
</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The project will target 2000 adolescent girls and 1000 boys directly from Mzuzu rural area, local leaders and other key members - the District Health Management Teams (DHMT), Hospital directors, District Executive Committee (DEC), District Technical Committees, District Education management team, school directors, Parents Teachers Associations and Local leaders The program will also reach over 100,000 rural communities through outreach activities.

</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Adolescent girls face a lot of problems as they transcend to adulthood. Most of these are related to their sexual and reproductive health (SRH). Adolescent girls are recognized as one of the underserved categories and their SRH related issues exist without concrete action plan in many developing counties. There is marked absence of reliable data and information, which is indicative of the priority given to this age group in most countries. Young people’s knowledge regarding RSH is limited.  There is therefore an urgent need to provide proper services for contraceptives, HIV testing, Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) treatment, condoms etc for young people to meet their SRH needs. 
Inadequate information, lack of privacy, crowded waiting rooms, and general youth unfriendly environment are some of the barriers that youth face in accessing reproductive health services.  This has contributed significantly to the unacceptable levels of ill-health and mortality rate in Malawi. 

</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: 1.	The establishment and empowerment of 40 adolescent girls groups in rural communities and schools. These will be spaces where girls can comfortably meet on a weekly basis, to discuss issues affecting them including issues of sexual reproductive health, HIV/Aids, gender, human rights, education and develop initiatives to improve their situation.
2.	Establishment of and empowering 20 boys networks to be champions for gender justice and gender empowerment. There is a dire need to target men and boys to take a stand in promoting women’s and girls’ empowerment and stop abuse of girls. This can be done when men/boys examine and confront patriarchal values whilst embracing gender equality principles to foster harmonious relations between men/boys and women/girls in the communities.
3.	Develop a comprehensive SRH and gender training  toolkit for school patrons and teachers in primary schools and orient them on how to use and apply this tool  in school based SRH and gender activities and sessions with boys and girls networks. 
4.	Develop and produce a comic-book. The story book will act as discussion tool for girls and boys in clubs to develop skills and knowledge on adolescent reproductive health and life skills. 
5.	Summer camps for girls’ leaders of the girls networks. During these five day camps, the girls will get sound reproductive health and rights information but also work on issues of self esteem, life skills, relationships, by way of alternative for the initiation ceremonies.
6.	Multi-stakeholders dialogue sessions to deliberate on issues of adolescent girls including sharing the results of the key findings of the baseline study at both local and district levels. This will be a platform for lobbying the District Health Management Teams (DHMT), Hospital directors, District Executive Committee (DEC), District Technical Committees, District Education Management Team, school directors, Parents Teachers Associations (PTAs) and Local leaders for an improvement in institutional compliance with the standards for youth friendly health services as stipulated in the sexual reproductive health and rights policy in the 10 rural health centers as well as safe schools for girls education.
7.	Training local drama groups in interactive theatre for social change. 10 drama groups will be trained in interactive drama skills, messaging and reporting. The trainings will strengthen the local capacity to play an active role in achieving improved adolescent health and rights. The groups will then be organizing and conducting local leaders dialogue and action forums on  cultural and traditional practices and beliefs that fuel sexual abuse, early marriage and gender based violence using theatre for social change. 
8.	Baseline and evaluation studies. The baseline study will be conducted at the beginning of the project and this will be a benchmark for monitoring and evaluation. This will include institutional appraisal to assess compliance with the standards for Youth Friendly Health Services as specified in the Malawi’s SHRP policy and national standards on Youth Friendly Health Services in the 10 rural health centers as well as levels of violence against girls in schools. 
</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The program will be built on existing local community structures and build and strengthen their capacities. The trained leaders and peer educators will work as community volunteers/ facilitators and hence the acquired skills and knowledge will remain in the community and live beyond project period. In addition the use of participatory approaches and user friendly tools will make the interventions community friendly and the communities quickly adopt and own the project as their own; this is because the communities themselves will be the driver of the process and the skills acquired are transferrable and replicable to reach more peers and a wider community.  The project will promote community participation and hence building of ownership to enable communities identify and solve own health program through the use of community action cycle approach and this will ensure sustainability of the project. The project will also train and involve government extension workers, school directors and patrons and work in partnership with ministries of health and of women, child and social welfare and ministry of education whose presence in the communities is permanent this will again ensure continuity of the project interventions beyond the grant period.  The SRH and gender toolkits for patrons, school directors, peer educators and community health workers that will be developed and published will be copied and distributed in schools, girls and boys networks and health centers so that the tool remains available beyond the grant period to initiate discussions in the community and boys and among girls so the same with the comic book. In the case of the summer camps are so successful that we would want to scale up that element of the program we would use the project period to invent a model that can be sustained beyond this project either with other donors or through a model of Malawian sponsors. </description>

    <title>Increased community resilience to disasters</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Integrating community managed disaster risk reduction and entrepreneurship
</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Through this programme, Cordaid and CADECOM (the Catholic Development Commission of the Episcopal Conference of Malawi) work together to provide capacity building, increase community resilience, disseminate knowledge and do lobby &amp; advocacy on disaster risk reduction &amp; entrepreneurship practices.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The overall objective of the 2013 - 2015 programme is:  To contribute towards increased community resilience to disasters, in 53 communities in 7 dioceses of Malawi, through promotion of Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction, Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation and Entrepreneurship strategies in Malawi by September 2015.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The direct target population consists of 4,770 households in 53 communities which are most vulnerable to disaster risks, in 7 dioceses of Malawi. This includes about 26,235 people (a community comprises of an average of 90 households, with an average 5.5 people per household). 
In addition, Civil Protection Committees at all levels in the 7 districts, policy makers, NGOs and networks in CMDRR, in Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) and/or in the agriculture sector will be directly targeted.
</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a population of 15.9 million people. Life expectancy is 39 years. 22% of the children are malnourished and 52% of the population lives below the absolute poverty line (less than 1USD per day). The economy relies heavily on agriculture, which accounts for 37% of the GDP. Since 2011, political unrest compromises the country’s stability. Tensions are mainly due to worsening fuel shortages, rising prices, high unemployment and poor governance. Additionally, Malawi faces a number of disasters, both natural and human-made, including floods, drought, landslides, HIV/AIDS and gender inequalities. Moreover, the intensity and frequency of disasters has been increasing, due to climate change, population growth, urbanization and environmental degradation. These hazards are a threat to people’s livelihoods, endanger human and food security, damage infrastructure and hinder socio-economic growth and development.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: Programme Description

The majority of the people in Malawi are affected by frequent disaster situations. Disaster risks are caused by e.g. the effects of climate change; high household  poverty levels; frequent natural hazards such as floods and droughts; limited capacity at all levels on CMDRR, CCA and entrepreneurship; and limited policies on DRR, CCA and Agriculture.

In order to address the issues/problems mentioned above, the Episcopal Conference of Malawi through her development arm, CADECOM, would like to implement a two year Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction and Entrepreneurship Programme in her eight Dioceses. The programme will entail increase in production which will reduce food gap, thereby enhancing food security, reducing insecurity from 9 months to zero months. Through the income generation activities, communities will be able to access food from purchase. It is also anticipated that if the early warning systems are collated and known, the communities will be able to locate or find strategies to cope so that the hazards do not turn into disasters. Environmental management will reduce loss of soil fertility which has economic consequences and the livelihood of the affected populations. The capacity of the target communities, civil protection committees will as well be strengthened by the end of the second year to enable them to mainstream community managed disaster risk reduction and entrepreneurship efforts into their development efforts. 

Programme Overall Goal:
To contribute towards increased community resilience to disasters through promotion of Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction, Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation and entrepreneurship strategies in 7 dioceses of Malawi by September 2015. 

Programme Specific Objectives: 
In order to contribute towards increased community resilience to disasters by September, 2015, the programme will specifically aim to achieve the following five objectives.
I.	To improve and sustain the livelihoods of 53 communities through small scale mitigation works by September, 2015.
II.	To promote environmental rehabilitation and protection through afforestation, use of low carbon technologies and management of already established woodlots by the targeted 53 communities by September, 2015. 
III. To build the capacity of 7 Civil Protection Committees at all levels (district, area and village) and 53 communities in CMDRR, CCA and entrepreneurship by September, 2015.
IV. To facilitate documentation and sharing of best practices in CMDRR, CCA and entrepreneurship with government, development partners and other stakeholders by September, 2015.
V.	To lobby and advocate for finalization and approval of national Disaster Risk Management, Climate Change and Agriculture policies and acts in Malawi by September, 2015

    <description type="1">Sustainability: Elements that contribute to the sustainability of our intervention involve the establishment of working groups, where members share resources and skills towards the achievement of a common goal. This is key to enhance the success and long term benefits of the project, as we engage communities at every stage and every level, from planning, building and financing to on – going project maintenance. Furthermore, the project implementation involves working with existing local structures, such as village committees, ensuring the sustainability of the intervention.  We believe that working through local communities, we are able to bring solutions tailored to their actual needs. Furthermore the use of the Community Managed Disaster Risk Approach places the beneficiary at the center of the process enabling them to prioritize hazards and develop appropriate measures to reduce the risk of the hazard becoming a disaster.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: The programme will be implemented in the period October 2013 - September 2015. At first, a one-year period is approved by Cordaid.

The project is a next phase to several former CMDRR projects of the Episcopal Conference of Malawi-Cadecom in Malawi. The present project will take place in 53 communities, of which 30 are new and 23 former communities. The former projects successfully managed to enhance the knowledge of community members on disaster risk issues that affect them. Communities have adopted Disaster Risk Approach in their daily lives. DRR coordination has been strengthened. </description>

    <title>Advocacy on resilience to climate change</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Enhance the resilience of farmers to climate change</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: In three districts, severly affected by droughts and floods due to climate change, disaster management platforms will be set up. District officials, farmers and civil society organisations will learn about effects of climate change and discuss proper policies and measures. Also issues on climate smart agriculture and farmer - private sector cooperation will be addressed in studies and advocacy. </description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: Through the capacity building of communities, district and national government agencies and civil society organisations, and through facilitating policy dialogue and advocacy, the Civil Society Agriculture Network (CISANET) contributes to reducing the risk of food insecurity and disasters in Malawi. In agricultural policies climate smart agricultur and disaster risk reduction will be mainstreamed.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The primary target group are the smallholder farmers. Also other agricultural sector players like NGOs and private sector organizations will greatly benefit from the interface among the sector players and anticipated policy changes. A third target group is the government, as CISANET and the other sector players will share their knowledge and studies on climate smart agriculture and disaster risk reduction with the government, aiming at mainstreaming these issues in policy development.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Climate change and its effects will continue to have devastating effects on agricultural productivity and outputs in Malawi.  Agriculture provides about 40 percent of GDP and employs about 80 percent of the entire workforce. Civil Society Agriculture Network (CISANET) works with its members, of whom some are already Cordaid partners for a long time, in the agriculture sector with the government over policy issues affecting smallholder farmers. CISANET has gained a good reputation in inflencing policies, like on food security, and in their implementation. This project focuses on developing an enabling environment for managing climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction related to climate change. </description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The project has 4 objectieves, to be achieved through the implementation of different activities.
-Develop the capacity of the NGOs and farmer organizations to understand climate change and disasters and their effects on food security
Activities: form and train district and community disaster management platforms; develop extension messages

-Faciltate policy dialogues between civil society/communities, government and the farmers on climate smart agriculture and the related risks of climate change
Activities: CISANET will facilitate thematic dialogues and radio programs on issues raised by communities

-Conduct studies that enrich the debate and the understanding on climate smart agriculture
Activities: studies will be commissioned and policy briefs developed from the studies conducted.

-Facilitate farmer - private sector cooperation on upscaling weather indexed insurance, climate smart agriculture and other programs as risk management tools
Activities: meetings between farmers and private sector, training on weather indexed insurance and demonstrations on climate smart agriculture</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: Through this project NGOs, farmers, communities and governments will learn on climate smart agriculture and disaster risk management in agriculture and food security. New or adjusted government policies will enhance mainstreaming of these issues and increase resilience of farmers to climate change. Cisanet will continue, also after this project, to provide a platform for dialogue for all sector players in climate smart agriculture and disaster risk management.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: This is the first time Cordaid supports a project of CISANET.</description>

    <title>Increasing community disaster resilience</title>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction approach aims to deliver sustainable results. Elements that increase sustainability are: 
-Working through the local partner ARCOD. We believe that local people know best how to solve their own problems. Locally based partners are better positioned to understand and navigate social, political, environmental and economic issues that will ultimately impact the project.
- An important component of the project is the capacity building on irrigation farming. Households practice irrigation farming as an income generating activity. The income realized from sales is deposited at a group account that will be used for procurement of inputs in the next growing season. Beneficiaries will be encouraged to open a group account where part of the proceeds from the sales will be kept for sustainability of the initiative.
- The tools used encourage participative monitoring through periodic reviews and fields visits. This will enable communities participating in this project be involved in monitoring. This will be one way of building ownership of the programme and hence sustainability.

</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: The programme is in implementation.

Activities meant to sustain achievements are: monitoring &amp; supervision, leadership training and construction of flood-proof housing. Activities that will be replicated are (e.g.): irrigation farming, livestock farming, building/strenghtening dykes, river bank protection, re-afforestation and promoting farming as a business. Innovative activities are: Village Savings and Loans, school &amp; community environmental competitions, DRR planning, construction of flood proof houses, irrigation and agricultural fairs.

    <description type="1">Subtitle: Resilience through CMDRR, Climate Adaptation and Entrepreneurship 2013-2014</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Vulnerable communities in 5 areas of Karonga District, northern Malawi will be trained and will work on Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction, including climate change adaptation and entrepreneurship activities. Thus communities build their resilience to disasters. The 2013/2014 programme is developed based on achievements made in the past two years and on staff trainings that ARCOD attended. </description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The overall objective of the program is to increase community disaster resilience in the 5 areas (T/A's) Kyungu, Mwakawoko, Mwansambo, Kilupula and Mwilang’ombe in Karonga District, northern Malawi, by end of 2014. The specific objectives relate to flood risk reduction (river bank protection); drought risk reduction (drought resistant crops, irrigation); entrepreneurship (farmers' cooperatives, village savings and loans); integration of DRR in  community development plans; capacity building and  knowledge management; and mitigation of climate change impact (natural resource management).

</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The programme targets 5,000 households in total (about 30,000 people) in Karonga District. Due to the effect of HIV and AIDS on the well-being of the communities, the programme gives special attention to vulnerable groups such as orphans, widows and people living with HIV and AIDS. Realizing that women are most affected by natural hazards, as farmers and caretakers, the program will also focus on women empowerment to increase their participation and their resilience to floods and droughts. 
</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world. It has a population of about 15.9 million. Agriculture is the main source of income to almost 85% of the population, and most of them are smallholder farmers. The country faces a number of disasters, both natural and human-made, including floods, drought, landslides and HIV/AIDS and gender issues. These hazards threaten people’s livelihoods, endanger human and food security, damage infrastructure and hinders socio-economic development. Currently the agricultural season is threatened by erratic seasonal rains and prolonged dry spells. Also the North of Malawi is very disaster prone for droughts and floods. Cordaid and implementing partner ARCOD help vulnerable families to reduce risks to natural hazards and to increase community resilience through the implementation of disaster risk interventions (including climate change adaptation) and promotion of agro-based income generating activities.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The new programme will run from December 2013 until November 2014. It is developed based on achievements made in the past two years of implementation, stakeholders review meetings, recommendations and results of a programme evaluation, and staff trainings that ARCOD attended. 
In line with the foregoing, the new programme will adopt three approaches: (a) replication of programme activities that have been useful in achieving the programme's goal in 3 new areas; (b) innovative and new activities that came out during stakeholders review meetings, the evaluation, lessons learnt and staff trainings attended; (c) activities meant to sustain achievements made in the 2 former areas.

The programme has the following specific objectives: 
1) To reduce community risk to flood through implementation of disaster risk reduction interventions that include river bank protection, strengthening dykes and construction of flood proof houses.
2) To reduce community risk to drought through promotion of agricultural diversification (animal production), planting of drought tolerant crops and promotion of irrigation farming.
3) To increase and sustain community resilience to disasters in Karonga through promotion of farming a business, formation of cooperatives and Village saving and loans.
4) To facilitate communities integrating DRR in all community development plans through facilitation of Participatory Disaster Risk Reduction Assessments (PDRRA).
5) To facilitate the development and adoption of community bylaws regarding animal grazing to protect trees and crops from cattle destruction.
6) To build the capacities of communities in new program areas through training on program activities.
7) To mitigate the impact of climate change through implementation of climate change adaptation techniques that includes re-forestation, rehabilitation of catchment areas, woodlot establishment and promotion of schools competition on woodlot and natural resources management.

    <title>Integrating farming and risk reduction</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Support to farmers in entrepreneurship and disaster risk reduction</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: To increase farmers'sustainablity and economic benefits it is important to offer services aimed at setting up feasible and profitable agricultural activities for local farmers. The project will train trainers in offering these kind of services to farmers. After being trained themselved, diocesan staff will further train communities in the same manner. </description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: Staff of the national and diocesan Catholic Development Commissions (Cadecom) need skills and knowledge in farm business managementin order to support and train local farmers, not only in reducing risks of disasters but also in strengthening their economic base.  </description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The target group consists of 41 staff members from the national and diocesan Cadecomss and a few government extension workers in the districts where the dioceses operate. </description>
    <description type="1">Background: The Cadecom national office is part of the Episcopal Conference of Malawi (ECM) and coordinates the programs of the 8 diocesan Cadecoms. The main focus is on disaster risk reduction and emergency aid. Research shows that measures like dyke construction are indeed effective in flood reduction, but that the targeted farming households often remain extremely poor and cannot increase their income, because they lack the knowhow and the skills to run their farms in a more businesslike manner. Therefore, there is a need to promote a businesses approach to farming and farm marketing among the communities, This improves their food security, increases their income and makes communities more resilient to natural hazards. </description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: Cadecom national office organizes three trainings between November 2012 to March 2013, being 
- a training in Entrepreneurship, business management and marketing skills, 
- a training in village savings and Loan Associations,
- a training in mainstreaming of entrepreneurship/DRR in existing projects. 
For each training Cadecom national office has selected external trainers, coming from the Ministry of Agriculture, the National Smallholder Farmers Association of Malawi (NASFAM), the Kusamala Institute of Agriculture and Ecology and CARE Malawi. Cadecom national office has provided a training schedule and an overview of the topics covered per training. This capacity building project will also include an inter-diocesan exchange visit to a community that is already integrating entrepreneurship in their existing program.
</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability:  Staff of Cadecom national office will continue to support diocesan Cadecoms in applying and transferring their new knowledge and skills in the diocesan programs and activities, strengthening communities in DRR as well as farming as a business.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: The workshop Integrating Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction and Agricultural Entreprreneurship was held in July 2012 in Lilonge, organized by the national office of Cadecom, with support from Cordaid and NASFAM (National Smallholder Farmers Association of Malawi). Also few staff members of the national office participated in the workshop. At the end of the workshop participants were invited to submit action plans for capacity building in their own organization. National Cadecom submitted the action plan, as described here.</description>

    <description type="1">Sustainability: The Nkhoma Safe Motherhood program has been successful and will continue to build local capacity to carry out the activities. Cross sections of the community, government and NGO partners have been and will continue to be involved in the planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation of the program. There will also be sharing of financial, human and technical resources in the implementation of the program. The program will continue use of existing structures and systems and creating new structures to discuss and make decisions on important issues to implement the project. Project participants and stakeholders will be involved to carry out the project through ensuring their participation in each step of project cycle and also linking with their own performance and benefit to ensure and develop ownership. Exit strategies will be reviewed from the other areas were the program is being implemented. The monitoring of the project activities will be incorporated in the existing Monitoring and Evaluation plan. Capacity building of the concerned stakeholders will be done to carry out the project activities. Successful interventions which have proven to be most sustainable are here below.

Bicycle Ambulances
The bicycle ambulances were distributed to each group village head to be used for transport from the community to the health facility. The villages each formed bicycle maintenance committees were representatives of the committees go into the community collecting money to support the upkeep of the bicycles. The community members contribute money for maintenance. Bank accounts have been opened and managed to maintain this activity. This has shown strong community ownership. This bicycle ambulance intervention was based on the success of the participatory action research model in the Mangochi Safe Motherhood program. This success is the key to the scaling up of this activity.

Women’s Groups
The women’s groups have been trained on the Plan-Do-See-Act (PDSA) cycle, where each group discusses to identify main diseases and isolate causes and how to avoid. The groups have identified the need for nutrition efforts, and have started collectively growing vegetables as a supplemental nutrition source and also a source of income. The need to address malaria in pregnancy was also raised and the two strategies implemented have been the clearing of swampy wet areas to reduce mosquito breeding and to encourage women to go for antenatal care where they receive antimalarials.7

Area Development Committees
The area development committees (ADC) have completed initial and follow-up refresher trainings. ADC meetings are held monthly and each meeting includes topics of maternal and child health. When deliveries have been conducted outside of a health facility, the individual names are raised and the ADC devises ways to address such cases. The program has been successful in getting maternal and child health topics discussed at each month meeting, and connecting these topics with community actions on ownership of community maternal and child health. Such resulted in increased monthly and annual facility deliveries by skilled personnel.
