    <title>Support The Establishment Of A Technical Centre For Disaster Risk Reduction And Climate Change Adaptation For Southern Africa (Dimsur)</title>
    <description>According to the above identified needs, UN-Habitat is of the opinion that the objective of the initiative, which seeks to establishment of a Technical Centre for southern Africa (DIMSUR) with the mandate of providing DRR and CCA assistance and knowledge, is fully justified. The several consultations held with the 4 countries which will be initially concerned by the Centre, and the feasibility study carried out, show the following opportunities.
§ Establish a permanent sub-regional institution which can provide technical support on DRR to national governments, SADC, NGOs, UN partners and community-based organisations beyond the life of projects and programmes, with aim at gradually reducing the dependency from external support.
§ Better serve and further strengthen the implementation of DRR practices, policies and activities at national level.
§ Enable knowledge, information sharing and exchanges between countries with aim at reinforcing capacities at the national level.
§ Maximise the use/strengthen existing capacities and expertise in the sub-region, so that needed expertise can be readily mobilised upon demand from the countries or other partners.
§ Optimise the use of available resources and increase coordination for addressing common DRR concerns and challenges in the sub-region.
§ Establish a defined agenda that aims at covering key thematic and capacity gaps, such as the urban theme, to meet the current demand and add value; build innovative programmes.
§ Create an enabling environment to bring the DRR and CCA agendas more effectively together.
§ Assist countries in developing a sustainable recovery and longer-term DRR programme.
§ Complement/reinforce the work of the SADC DRR Unit through the provision of technical support.
§ Further increase the understanding of DRR at the national level and raise awareness at all levels.
§ Increase the visibility of national governments/partners on DRR/CCA at the regional/global scales.
§ Communication in the three official languages spoken in SADC.
The Technical Centre to be established should remain at the cutting edge of DRR concepts and practice, be flexible in the management of its programme and able to be innovative and relevant. Hence, by initially focussing on urban resilience, the centre is already orienting itself towards technical specialities that give it its individuality. Proper tools need to be quickly developed and training and capacity building activities delivered in collaboration with existing institutions.</description>

    <title>Regional Multi-Sectoral Drr Assistance Programme For Southern Africa (Un-Habitat Basc Infrastructure , Shelter And Urban Risk Assistance)</title>
    <description>

The purpose of this project is to address four main areas, that
     concur to increased vulnerability to the effects of natural disasters:
     

o
Lack of capacities and structured experiences in
addressing urban risk, reduce risks
and build resilience in cities frequently affected by natural disasters in
Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar;

o
Lack of capacities of the National Disaster
Institutions to capitalize and
structure the many good practices implemented, which results in huge losses of
resources

o
Lack of harmonized practices at the regional level and low level of mutual learning among countries that
share the same hazards and risks

o
Weak capacities of communities in human settlements in
Mozambique to build safely and
rebuild with improvement or retrofitting better houses and community
infrastructure (i.e. schools). The focus on Mozambique for this aspect is due
to a direct request of ECHO, in response to cyclone Funso that affected
Mozambique in 2012.

UN-Habitat, in partnership with other UN agencies (and in
     particular FAO), is well placed to contribute in addressing the causes of
     the problems, thanks to 10 years of experience in DRR in the sub-region,
     established partnership and reputations at regional level via the upcoming
     DIMSUR Centre and presence in the 3 main countries of the action. It will:

o
develop the first
innovative Urban Risk and Resilience instrument in the sub-region, by engaging
experts, local governments and partners in the elaboration of the tool and in
its testing at city-level

o
document all
shelter, housing and infrastructure resistant practices hand-in-hand with the National
Institutions, so to publish do's and don'ts, which might be turned into
National Policies

o
provide technical
assistance and support data management to all DRR partners in its field of
expertise (Housing and Shelter; Land Tenure; Planning)

o
rebuild as
on-the-job training at least 15 community schools and 50 houses, hand-in-hand
with INGC and Ministry of Public Works to document the practice and include it
in the Disaster Contingency Planning of Mozambique



All priorities
have been established (Ref. assessments) along with the 4 categories of
beneficiaries this projects benefits, as detailed below



Given the
complexity of this context the problem can only by addressed by a broad
partnership of international actors, along with national to local authorities.
For this reason a technical partnership has been established, through the
DIPECHO III project at regional level among UN-Habitat, FAO, CARE and COOPI and
at national level in the 3 countries with a number of partnering UN agencies,
NGOs and the Red Cross. Then, this project has been designed in parallel with 3
other projects designed by FAO, CARE and COOPI in respective areas of
expertise, with a common overall logical framework and same areas of
intervention. 



Within this
partnership, UN-Habitat will provide high-level policy advisory services, along
with technical support and direct implementation to all categories of
beneficiaries and to its partners.



The purpose of
this project will therefore be to:Ensuring the
capitalization along with National to Local authorities in the 3 countries of
DRR/M practices on Housing and Basic Community Infrastructure resistant to
Disaster, so to take stock and transform practices into policies. (In common
log-frame with FAO, COOPI, CARE); IMPORTANT:
This strategy complements the Sub-Regional
DRR Technical Centre for Human Settlements (DIMSUR) that the World Bank is
funding from 2012 to UN-Habitat;

Delivering
innovative Urban Risk Reduction
training modules at regional level and pilot DRR Planning in cities. This will
address lacking instruments on urban resilience in Southern Africa and know-how
in selected cities (In common log-frame
with FAO, COOPI, CARE);

Delivering
qualified technical assistance on request to National and Local Authorities, as
well as partnering agencies and NGOs in the 3 countries on Basic Infrastructure
and Housing/Shelter. (Multi-disciplinary
assistance provided in common with FAO, COOPI, CARE);

Developing and
mainstreaming low-cost, highly
reproducible techniques in Mozambique to build-back better after 2012 disasters
and reduce future occurrences. National Institutions will be engaged from the
start to turn practices into national policy
