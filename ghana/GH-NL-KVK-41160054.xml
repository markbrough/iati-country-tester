    <title>Construction of an eye clinic</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Expansion of the eye clinic in Bolgatanga</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The project consists of the construction of an eye ward with 25 beds at the existing eye clinic in Bolgatanga.  This eye clinic is under the management of the Bawku Hospital Eye Department of the Presbyterian Health Services.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: To construct an eye ward at the eye clinic in Bolgatanga.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The target group of this project are patients with eye problems.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: The Bawku Eye Care Project in the Upper East region of Ghana, which was started more than three decades ago, has become one of the major eye care programs in the country. Until 2009, Bawku was the only static clinic, but now the clinics in Bolgatanga and Garu also have become static. The activities carried out in the Eye Care Project are consultations at the Out Patient Department (OPD), surgeries, optical services (provision of glasses), laser services, local production of eye drops and eye screening in schools. Yearly more than 60.000 patients are seen at the Out Patient Department of the eye clinics, and more than 3000 cases were operated.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The realization of the eye ward will be done by clearing the ground, the construction of the building and the installation of the electricity and water provision. The equipment of the 25 beds has already been transported from the Westeinde Hospital in The Hague to Bolgatanga.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The eye clinic is part of the Bawku Eye Program of the Bawku Hospital Eye Department. This hospital is responsible for the staffing of the eye clinic, as well as the maintenance of the building. </description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: In the last years, the eye centre in Bolgatanga had started by the construction of an Out Patient Department (OPD), which consist of the consulting rooms and a waiting area for patients. In addition, an operating theater has already been build. Now there is need for the construction of an eye ward.</description>

    <title>Providing farmers with access to credit</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Improving a new development company for providing rural financial services</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Small scale farmers in the poor regions of northern Ghana have difficulties making clear agreements on selling produce as they lack access to credit to improve their businesses. In response, AFS (ACDEP Financial Services), a new company established by ACDEP (Association of Church Development Projects) has set up a program to provide financial services to thousands of farmers.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The main objectives of this project are to provide access to credit for 12000 farmers and establish at least 10 cooperations with rural and commercial banks, while professionalizing AFS.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: This project has been designed for the benefit of farmers in the three northern regions of Ghana. This target group is reached through Cordaid's partner organization ACDEP (Association of Church Development Projects), a network of 42 local development projects. ACDEP not only facilitates the exchange of experiences, but its office also offers coordinated contact with the government and other stakeholders. It furthermore offers capacity building trainings to its members.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: In Ghana's three northern regions, where 80% of the population depends on small scale agriculture, poverty is on the rise. ACDEP has worked in the last few years on improving the dialogue between producers/farmers and traders. It has also initiated the establishment of a company, which provides agreements for farmer groups on volumes, varieties and moments for selling agricultural produce. However, to successfully participate farmers need better access to credit. In the last few years ACDEP has cooperated with several banks to try out various models of providing credit. It recently decided to launch ACDEP Financial Services (AFS), functioning as a connection between banks and farmer groups and providing easy access to credit for framers.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: In order to meet the mentioned goals ACDEP Financial Services (AFS) will cooperate closely with all chain stakeholders and (potential) financial service providers. AFS will furthermore facilitate the communication, monitor production and verify agreements between various stakeholders.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: By providing access to credit and improving linkages with financial institutions, farmers in the northern regions of Ghana will be enabled to improve their agriculture businesses on the long term.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: Cordaid has been working with the ACDEP network since the mid-90s. The previous phase of this program consisted of a pilot project, in which some tasks were carried out by other stakeholders. In this phase AFS will become a professional organization, taking on more responsibilities.</description>

    <title>Support Healthcare of chronic diseases</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Training health staff to deal with chronic diseases such as diabetes. 
</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Chronic diseases are becoming a big problem in developing countries such as Ghana. Therefore, Cordaid and Ghaned for Health, work together with the Abura Dunkwa Hospital in the development of this project for the prevention, treatement and awareness raising on the chronic diseases diabetes and hypertension. This project consists of the training of health staff and the building of an health clinic.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The main goal of the project is the improvement of the knowledge in Ghana in the field of hypertension and diabetes, and the improvement of care for people with those chronic diseases.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The target groups of the project are:

- (potential) patients with hypertension or diabetes in the Abura Dunkwa District (2.500 adults)
- women who will receive information on the prevention of those diseases;
- health staff and Community Health Workers, working in the Abura Dunkwas Hospital (2 women), health staff in the centre for basic health care in the district (8 women, 2 men) and the health staff working in hte communities of Abura Dunkwa District (10 women)</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Ghaned for Health is an organization of Dutch doctors and nurses. The organization has the aim to develop, together with Ghanaian counterparts, a better health care for patients with chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension. 

Chronic diseases are becoming a big problem in developing countries like Ghana. Because there are no symptoms, people mostly visit the doctor when complications occur, like a stroke or a heart attack. 

The hospital staff of the Abura Dunkwa hospital and Dutch doctors and nurses decided to make a programme for better health care for patients with chronic diseases

A stakeholders meeting was organized in 2011 by the hospital staff and Ghaned for Health to analyze the health care problems for patients with chronic diseases and what would be needed for a common approach on the subject. After this meeting this project proposal was written.
</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The project plan consists of exchange of information with organizations/doctors in Ghana, the development of a protocol, the development of a training programme for health staff workers, the implementation of the training, the building of a health clinic and the development of a plan for future development of the project with all stakeholder in Central Region.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The focus of the project is on transfer of knowledge from the Dutch doctors to health staff workers in Ghana in order to enable them to continue this project after this first phase. Furthermore, the project aims at the development of care at decentral level, which means it is accessible for the local people.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: At this moment, the knowledge in the field of chronic diseases in Ghana is limited. Also, the compliance of patients for treatment for chronic diseases is very low.</description>

    <title>Development of a low cost Ultrasound</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Preventing and reducing maternal mortality by using ultrasound diagnostics</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The development of a low cost compact ultrasound could offer the possibility of broader use ultrasound in a low-resource setting and therefore reduce maternal mortality rates. 

</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: •	Develop a low cost novel ultrasound transducer aimed for obstetric diagnostics. The unit should be composed of a few components and interface with a PC, laptop or tablet through a standard USB-2/3 connection
•	Develop easy to use software for image acquisition, transfer and storage. Software should be OS in depend and run on a variety of cheap devices (i.e cheap android tablets, google laptop etc.)
•	Production of low cost ultrasound devices (20-30 units) to be tested on the ground in i.e two (African) countries.

</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: Midwives, medical practioners and  midwifery teaching institutions </description>
    <description type="1">Background: Almost all (99%) of the 536.000 maternal deaths (WHO 2005 figures) occur in the developing world. Because of this there is a broad agreement on the need to improve obstetric health in the developing world: The United Nations has declared reducing child mortality by two-thirds as goal 4 of its “millennium development goals “ and reducing maternal deaths by three-fourths as goal 5.

Ultrasound is an important diagnostic tool for prenatal care but it is rarely available in the developing world.  The development of a low cost compact ultrasound could offer the possibility of broader use ultrasound in a low-resource setting and therefore reduce maternal mortality rates. 
</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: PHASE1 (1-3 MONTHS)
The first phase will involve the 4 four proposed partners to clearly identify the project proposal, find financial support and access possible test sites/countries.
PHASE2 (3-8 MONTHS) budget 
o	University of New Castle: Development of a first robust prototype to be tested in a “real life” setting. A first model is available but needs to be fine-tuned.
o	DIS Development of software platform for image acquisition, transmission and storage. Part of the software is already available from the CAD4TB package.
o	Cordaid Identify field test sites/countries. Setup a program for introduction of a new first line diagnostic tool for maternal care.

PHASE3 (9-10 MONTHS)
o	Newcastle/DIS production of 20-30 units for field testing
o	Newcastle/DIS installation, training of ultrasound units in the proposed test sites

PHASE4 (10-14 MONTHS)
o	Cordaid/DIS /Newcastle Test run at African sites. Identify potential benefits and challenges.
o	DIS/DIAG Data collection for development of CAD systems
o	Cordaid Development of training programs for mid wives

    <description type="1">Subtitle: Training farmers in Wenchi on best farming practices.</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The people in Wenchi are poor peasants with inadequate resources. Cordaid works together with the Afroeuro Foundation to assist these rural farmers to produce sufficient maize crop for local consumption and commercial purposes by providing training. Also, the project is an investment initiative for migrants in the diaspora who aims to channel their remittances for investment purposes.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The Food security project is a migrant initiative that aims to assist farmers to produce enough food surpluses that can be marketed to generate income for the purpose of improving quality of life. Also, the project encourages migrants in The Netherlands to support this project.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The intended benficiaries are 40 women and 60 youths in 10 communities in Wenchi area.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: The implementation of the Food security project began in 2010. The project emerged as a result of the Migration and Development Program, which the Afroeuro Foundation implemented in 2007. The Foundation acts as a bridge that connects migrants' resources in The Netherlands and the farmers in Ghana to achieve higher food production and economic development through improved incomes.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The following activities will be implemented:
- Capacity building and training of farmers on best organic farming practices,  improved maize seed farming and financial literacy training. Training will be done on quarterly basis.
- Contacting and establishing strategic partnership agreements with potential buyers to encourage marketing and distribution of harvested maize crops;
- Enhance provision of micro credit services to the farmers;
- Provide storage facility for farmers to store their maize produce before being sold;
- Increasing awareness on gender roles and the involvement of women in households food security planning and decision making;
- Enhance awareness raising on the project within the Ghanaian migrant community in the Netherlands and other European countries.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: Afroeuro Foundation will start partnerships for the sale of produce from the various farmer groups with companies in the region. Further, remittance senders will be advised to invest in the project in the coming years to enable the project to continue.</description>

    <title>Innovations for mother and child health</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: A comprehensive approach to combat maternal and infant mortality</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Despite recent progress maternal and infant mortality remains high in Ghana. Buidling upon best practices and experience from pilot projects, we have designed a comprehensive and multidimensional approach to improve mother and child health, addressing all aspects of access, from transport, communications, and support groups to skilled health workers, resultsbased financing and referral practices.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: Objective 1: Reduction of Maternal Mortality by 20% in 2015 through:
•	30% increase in deliveries by skilled birth attendance
•	20% improvement of antenatal care visits
•	25% reduction of maternal infections
 
Objective 2: Reduction of Infant Mortality by 15% in 2015 through:
•	30% increase of attendance under 5 clinic for infants &lt; 1 year
•	30% increase post natal care visits
•	25% improved child nutrition
</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: About 20,000 pregnant women, mothers and infants in rural areas will be directly targeted. Indirectly the projects affects around 100,000 people, i.e. the families of the direct target group.
</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Maternal mortality stands at 350 deaths per 100.000 life births and infant mortality at 51 per 1,000 life births. In the past decennium efforts have been made to improve women’s health.  A major reform has been the introduction of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). Started in 2004/5, the aim of the NHIS was to improve access to quality health care for all Ghanaians registered, especially the poorest population. In July 2008 the (NHIS) has introduced the free maternal care programme in Ghana. This introduction has significantly improved maternal health. For example, great improvements were seen in antenatal care coverage to over 90%. But is it also acknowledged that this has led to strong focus on curative care and less attention for public health.  Therefore, great challenges remain that need to be tackled to reduce the maternal and infant mortality rates further. </description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: Activity targets to achieve the objective 1: Reduction of Maternal Mortality by 20% in 2015 through a 30% increase in deliveries by skilled birth attendance, 20% improvement of antenatal care visits, 25% reduction of maternal infections include
•	Handing out bracelets for 20.000 pregnant women and babies on antenatal visits
•	Training 400 traditional birth attendants with safe delivery kits
•	Training 20 midwifes
•	10 health facilities involved in resultsbased financing
•	30 health staff trained (3 staff per facility)
•	30 Safe Motherhood clubs established
•	300 community sessions on child nutrition
•	6 locations with mobile phone use
•	3 locations with multimedia training
•	4 locations with improved transport possibilities 
•	Datacollection, lobby &amp; advocacy, article writing
</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The sustainability of the programme is safeguarded in multiple ways:
•	The programme will be completely integrated in the daily practice of the health centers and community. Existing staff will be responsible for facilitating and implementing the programme.
•	Community involvement including the work of the TBA’s will be largely on voluntary bases with limited incentives. 
•	The multimedia component of the programme will contribute to more effective and efficient TBA training tools in the future. 
•	The programme includes and important lobby, documentation and research aspect that will make it possible to show the results and the cost-effectiveness of the programme to other stakeholders and government. The joint midterm review will facilitate the collaboration and it is therefore expected that further scale-up this programme in the rural areas can be supported by government or donors.    
</description>

    <title>Portable water for Botogwina</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Construction of a water borehole.</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Cordaid works together with the Dutch Foundation The True Vine and its local partner organization Belojosh Foundation for the purpose of this project. The project consists of the provision of clean portable water and direct supply of water for irrigation for the community of Botogwina. Volunteers will be trained for the operation and maintenance of the water borehole.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The goals of the project are:
- to provide clean portable water for the community of Botogwina;
- To supply water for irrigation;
- To decrease the workload of women and children fetching water for the households;</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The target group are the 3750 inhabitants of the community of Botogwina.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Cordaid and the True Vine already worked together in a water project in Borko Korpe, which has been succesfully completed in August 2013. The Botogwina Town Council saw this project in Borko Korpe and asked the True Vine and the Belojosh Foundation to develop a similar project for the residents of Botogwina. At this moment, the residents of Botogwina fetch their water from a river 10 km from the village, but this water is very contaminated.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The project will consists of the following:
- Training of the management team;
- Recruitment and training of volunteers for the operation and maintenance of the borehole;
- Organization of information meetings for the community;
- Drilling the borehole;
- Construction of the water tank;
- Installation of the electricity system;
- Investigation of the water treatment if needed;</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The actual building of the borehole will take eight months. Then, the team of trained volunteers will take over the running of the borehole. The Water Management Committee will supervise the installation in the longer term. 

The maintenance costs will come from a levy on every household. The collection of the contributions will be done by the Botogwina Town Council and managed by the Water Management Committee.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: This is the second project on which Cordaid and the True Vine are working together.

In the Northern region in 2008, only 47% of the women were provided with information on signs of pregnancy complications, the percentage of women who receive two or more tetanus injections during last pregnancy increased from 50% in 2003 to 56% in 2008. Teenage pregnancy and childbearing contribute to high maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, thus preventing girls from attaining an education and achieving financial stability.
Adolescents’ lack of knowledge on early sexual development and reproductive also continue to pose a serious health risk through unprotected sex in young people. Adolescent reproductive health is affected by pregnancy, abortion, STDs, and limited access to information and clinical services. </description>

    <title>Health Advocacy Project</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Training community in advocacy for reproductive rights and improved service</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The Alliance for Reproductive Health Rights (ARHR) supports this project in Ghana. ARHR advocates for improved maternal health in Ghana. It trains young women in reproductive rights and lobby. It engages government, Ministry of Health for training midwives, provision of emergency obstetric care and family planning services.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: To contribute to achieving the health related MDG (4, 5 and 6) in Ghana – leading to reductions in under five mortality rate by two-thirds, reductions in maternal mortality by three-quarters, halting the spread of HIV.</description>
    <description type="3"/>
    <description type="1">Background: In 2000, Ghana committed to the Millenium development Goals (MDGs). For some of the goals, Ghana is on the right trach, like the one for education. For MDG 4 and 5, progress is worse. The child and maternal mortality rate is increasing, especially in rural areas. The maternal mortality rate in Ghana is 560 per 100,000 live births. The percentage of pregnant women delivering under supervision of skilled staff is only 45%. 
Furthermore, there are problems with regard to clean drinking water, sanitation, malaria and a lack of qualified health staff, bad roads and poor transportation systems. 

In the focus districts of this project, the health infrastructure is inadequate beacuse of growing population. 

There are not enough trustworthy data on health indicators and civil society organizations are not enough involved in monitoring. people in the community are lacking knowledge on their rights for good health care.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: 1. The in- and output of health prgrammes is monitored at district level, in a participatory way. Data are presented in reports and are used for lobby on district and national level.
2. Responsibility and transparancy of government on MDGs 3, 4 and 5 is improved by budget tracking.
3. The ARHR, the NGO member organizations and the Health Platform will be capacitated in research and lobby skills with regard to national health processes.
4. Links are created between community and district level health facilities to improve the sense of the community for their right to health care.

Within the project, there is special attention for healh care personnel, contraception and reproductive health care for adolescents. Also attention is paid to district level health infrastructure - Community-Health Based Compounds/Centres. </description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: This project aims particulary at capacity building for civil society organizations and communities at district level, to monitor progress on MDGs 4, 5 and 6. In this way, people are more aware of their rights and can press governments to intensify health programmes.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: In June 2007 Cordaid firstly started a financing project with ARHR.</description>

    <title>Social Performance of MFIs</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Social Performance Management in Sub-Saharan Africa</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) that aim to serve the poor must demonstrate how they are meeting this goal. We support the implementation of measurement tools for Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya and Uganda. We utilize the Progress out of Poverty Index® (PPI®),  a tool developed by Grameen Foundation. By using this tool MFIs can measure their social performance and achievement of their social objectives.
</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The PPI is a poverty measurement tool that helps MFIs undertake proper targeting of clients, understand their poverty outreach, determine their poorest clients' needs, identify the products or approaches that are most effective in helping the poor, and track changes in client poverty over time. This data allows organizations to make more informed strategic decisions and, in turn, their programs can be more successful in aiding the poor. We will assist MFIs to build their institutional capacity to effectively adopt and integrate PPI report and use this information for decision making. </description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: We will support Grameen Foundation, who has developed the Progress out of Poverty Index (PPI). to assist MFIs in implementing the tool. The PPI is a poverty measurement tool that helps poverty-focused organizations. This project will target poverty-focused microfinance institutions in Ethiopia, Kenya, Ghana, Tanzania and Uganda. </description>
    <description type="1">Background: Grameen Foundation was founded in 1997 to help the world's poorest people reach their full potential, connecting their determination and skills with the resources they need.  Grameen Foundation provides access to essential financial services and essential information on agriculture and health, as well as develops tools to improve the effectiveness of poverty-focused organizations. Their collaborative approach to poverty alleviation recognizes the multidimensional and complex nature of global poverty. 
Grameen Foundation has been working in Sub-Saharan Africa for more than a decade, improving the livelihoods of the region’s poor by building relevant mobile-based solutions and increasing access to financial services. 
</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: Grameen Foundation developed the Progress out of Poverty Index, a statistically-sound, yet simple to use tool. Chosen for its ease of implementation, the PPI consists of 10 multiple choice questions about a household and can be completed in about 5 minutes. By using this thool MFIs can measure their social perfromance and achievement of their social objectives. 
Cordaid's previous grant has enabled Grameen Foundation to successfully introduce and implement PPI as a Social Performance Management tool in Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya and Uganda, generate a list of interested MFIs and create an existing network of users. This creates the opportunity to further enable MFIs to measure their own effectiveness and better serve their target populations. 
This project will:
•	Continue to drive PPI adoption in Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda by deepening relationships with existing partners and working with at least seven new partners;
•	Develop at least one new partnership in Tanzania to drive PPI uptake and adoption;
•	Build capacity of MFIs to analyze and interpret PPI data for decision making purposes; and
•	Review and update the PPI build for Kenya. 
</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: Once MFIs have implemented PPI within their organizations and started the collection of PPI data, they will be able to use this tool for the rest of the life-time of the organization. Based on the PPI data and the analyses, the MFI knows if they are reaching the poor and which of their services and products have a positive impact on their lives. With this information the MFI is able to adapt its services and products to the needs of their clients. As a consequence, the clients will be more satisfied and remain a client of the MFIs. This ensures the financial sustainability of the MFI.  </description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: Cordaid started its relationship with Grameen Foundation in 2011. This collaboration has resulted in the increase of PPI user base in Sub-Saharan Africa to 17 organizations and a pipeline of 72 interested users. Grameen Foundation organized 13 PPI user trainings in Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya and Uganda and provided 4 PPI-user organizations with advisory services and certified one organization in PPI Standards of Use. </description>

    <title>Innovation in Sexual Reproductive Health</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Campaigns, diagnostic services and treatment capacity.</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: This three-year health development plan is focused on sexual and reproductive health. It addresses the gaps in the health service delivery by identifying feasible public health and clinical management interventions. It is expected that these interventions reduce morbidity and mortality associated with poor sexual reproductive health practices amongst women in the Goaso Diocesan area. </description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: To improve sexual and reproductive healthcare for women dependent on the Goaso Diocesan Health Service.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The Goaso Diocesan Health Service operates in three politico-administrative districts with a total catchment population of 382.574. These Districts comprise of Tano North District, Ahafo-Ano South District and Asutifi South District. Out of the 382.574, there are 91.818 women in their fertility age, who are the main beneficiaries of this project.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: The Goaso Diocesan Health overlaps in two Regions, Brong Ahafo and Ashanti Regions of Ghana. There are Four Diocesan Health facilities within Goaso Diocese and all these facilities are surrounded by about ten Ghana Health Service facilities.
 
An analysis of sexual and reproductive health problems in Goaso has yielded insight into a variety of factors that may be associated with poor sexual and reproductive health practices. Despite the public health importance of sexually transmitted infections, many of these factors have not had the attention they deserve. This project therefore aims to improve the responsiveness and adequacy of the health interventions in this area.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The program intends to serve mainly women and adolescents in the catchment areas of four diocesan health institutions in eight districts divided over Bron Ahafo and Ashanti Regions, with public health campaigns, diagnostic services and treatment capacity. It will focus on the general public with special attention to women and adolescents. For the services that Catholic Health Institutions cannot render linkages will be made with government hospitals in the same area.

The activities for this program are:
- Sexual reproductive health counseling
- Specialized counseling sessions schedules during and after normal working hours
- Post abortion care
- Counseling on the billing methods
- Conducting testing (provision of testing kits)
- Provision of nutritional support for affected women
- Re-organization of the People Living with HIV/AIDS association
- Institute know your status campaigns 
- Developing referral protocols and systems by the end of 3rd quarter 2013
- Referrals to Ghana Health Services Family Planning centers
- Training of essential staff on referrals systems and protocol use
- Quarterly review meetings 
- Setting up four microbiology unit at the laboratory units in four facilities by 2013
- Ensuring Early diagnosis, efficient management and treatment
- Organize quarterly performance review meetings 
- Training for service providers/staff on health education by 1st quarter 2013
- Training of peer educators 
- Distribution of behavioral change communication materials
- Improving transportation for public health activities
- To sponsor/train two Health Information System (HIS) officers by the end of 2014
- To restructure Health Information System: change of software
- To restructure Health Information System: Maintenance 
- Monitoring: field visits, review of monthly reports and hold clinical meetings.
- Evaluation: field visits, holding of clinical meetings and conduct joint review.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The health work of the Goaso Diocese already exists and will continue. If this project can successfully introduce innovations in the field of sexual reproductive health will among others depend establishing high quality and long lasting relationships with government health institutions in the area.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: The Health Service of Goaso Diocese is a longstanding partner of Cordaid, with a good reputation for its health work in Ghana. The diocesan project on Maternal Health Care that has run since 2007 was successful in bringing down maternal and infant mortality rates by improving antenatal care, malaria treatment during pregnancy, postnatal care as well as deliveries supported by skilled health personnel.</description>

    <title>Investing in a wholesale microfinance fund</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Access to credit for MFIs that target lower income families.</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: We are investing in a new wholesale micofinance fund (WMF) in Ghana, set up by KfW Development Bank and Cyrano. This fund will provide credit to microfinance institutions (MFIs) that focus on the low income segment in Ghana. In this way, the fund hopes to reach people that would otherwise not have had access to credit, so they can start businesses and improve their families' living conditions.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: By investing in this fund, we aim to provide capital for loans to financial service providers that target the lower income segment of Ghana. These financial service providers offer microcredit to micro-entrepeneurs that will enable them to grow their businesses. The ultimate goal is to enable people to improve the standard of living for themselves and their families. </description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: Any type of financial service provider operating in rural and urban areas: Microfinance Institutions, Savings and Loan cooperatives, Rural Banks, Financial NGOs and Credit Unions.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Cyrano is an experienced worldwide microfinance fund manager with more than 300 million USD under management.  Cyrano's funds generate a solid return on investment for industry investors. Until now, there haven't been any investees that have been late with repayment.  </description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: Development Bank KFW has asked Cyrano to set up a new Wholesale Microfinance Fund in Ghana. As the lead investor, KFW has heavily invested in the fund and will be covering operational losses for the first three years. 

In this phase, WMF will also focus specifically on rural oriented MFIs. Traditionally MFIs in Ghana were only lending in Accra and Kumasi, the two major cities in Ghana. WMF focuses on MFIs that expand their operations and open new branches outside of these 2 cities since the urban market is showing signs of saturation.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: WMF aims to be able to cover all its own operational costs by June 2013. Profit will be reinvested.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: By April 2013, 3 MFIs in Ghana received a loan from WMF.

    <title>Water supply for Youth City</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Providing access to clean drinking water</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: At the moment there is only a public water supply system in the surroundings of Youth City, which is unreliable and expensive. The system is sometimes closed or broken down. When this is the case, the youth needs to go to the stream and carry water back to Youth City. By investing in a water collection point, the inhabitants of Youth City will have their own access to water. </description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: In cooperation with the Inner Wheel Rijk van Nijmegen, Cordaid aims to support the Rural Youth Association in the construction of a water point to gain access to clean drinking water.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The direct target group is the organization the Rural Youth Association. The final beneficiaries will be the youth in Youth City and the surrounding population.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: The Rural Youth Association is established to provide vocational training to physically and mentally disabled youth and drops-outs in rural areas.  A part of the Rural Youth Association is the Youth City. This Youth City consists of a hairdresser and a sewing workshop where youth receive vocational training. At the site of Youth City, there is also a hostel for about 30 youth, who participate in the vocational training. </description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The project consists of the following activities:

- Contracting a company for the drilling, construction and mechanization of one borehole;
- Management and monitoring of the building of the water collection point.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The money made by the sale of the water will be used for the management and maintenance of the water collection point.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: This is the first time that Cordaid works together with the Inner Wheel Rijk van Nijmegen and the Rural Youth Association in Wenchi. The Inner Wheel Rijk van Nijmegen supports the Rural Youth Association in Wenchi since 2007.</description>

    <title>Helping the poor access health insurance</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Collecting data on the poor's access to national healthcare</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The innovation for participatory monitoring and evaluation (PartMe) is an ICT for development project that uses technology to facilitate data collection and information dissemination between SEND-Ghana, its grassroots partners and policy makers on the National Health Insurance Scheme. The project has developed and deployed an Information Management tool known as the Open Source Monitoring Tool.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The overall goal of SEND – Ghana’s health Program is to reduce inequality and enhance the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) on maternal, under five and infant mortality.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The direct target group is the SEND organization. Indirectly our project will extend to the fifty most fragile districts in the North and Greater Accra.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: The Ghanaian government instituted the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in 2003 to remove the financial barriers to quality health care for the poor. However, registration data suggests that this may not be the case. Only 2.3% taking part in the scheme are subsidized poor, while an estimated 28.5% of Ghana's population lives below the poverty line. Central to SEND-Ghana’s work on health is Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation of pro-poor health interventions. This participatory research generates issues of policy implementation on health for engagement with stakeholders at district, regional and national levels for change. For over five years, SEND relied on hard paper research in 50 districts, which made data collection very tedious and alleging. To address these challenges, the PartMe project pilot started in 21 districts and has shown that the project is feasible in terms of facilitating monitoring and evaluation of the NHIS. There is now up scaled all 50 districts</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: After the data has been collected and analyzed, key issues will be identified and appropriate strategies adopted to improve on the implementation of the NHIS. These strategies include the education or sensitization of communities that have a low rate of enrolment. Engaging key stakeholders at district or regional level in discussion of the findings for them to take concrete steps to address challenges within the NHIS system (both at access to NHIS as well as the quality of service provided by health facilities to NHIS members) will also be a vital outcome. </description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: SEND-Ghana is using the participatory monitoring and evaluation approach which allow the participation of citizens and local government structures (District Assemblies) in all stages of implementation of all projects/project. In addition, the project is building the capacities of Community based organizations and District Citizens Monitoring Committees in using evidence (research) as the basis for engaging state actors as well policy makers. These would ensure sustainability when the project exits.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: Since 2002, SEND-GHANA has inspired citizens’ participation in the implementation of the first and second generations of Ghana’s Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategies through the application of its Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation framework. The current phase of the Grassroots Economic Literacy and Advocacy Program (2008-2010) terminates year-end 2010 and as part of the process of developing a new 3-year phase (2011-2013) of the program, a situational analysis of Ghana has been undertaken to support and strengthen the program analytical process and design. </description>

    <title>SEISUD and ZEFP Ecological Farming</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Training farmers in ecological farming in Northern Ghana.</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Cordaid and the Stichting Ecologische Landbouwprojecten Ghana (ELPG) work together in the support of two projects in Northern Ghana: the Sirigu Initiative for Sustainable Development (SEISUD) and the Zasilari Ecological Farms Project (ZEFP). By means of those projects, knowledge of organic farming is spread among the local subsistence farmers</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: Cordaid, in collaboration with the foundation ELPG, intends to improve the living conditions of the farmers and the environment by learning the farmers to apply organic agriculture.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The direct target group is the foundation ELPG. The final beneficiaries are the male and female farmers and school leavers in rural areas in Northern Ghana.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: The Northern part of Ghana consists of a dry area with one period of rainfall. It is mainly inhabited by farmers. Many families suffer from hunger and poverty, as traditional agricultural methods do not yield sufficient produce. Farmers also lack knowledge of farming methods that would improve yields. Since 1975 the foundation ELPG supports different projects in the field of organic agriculture in this area, which has lead to improved yields and protection of the environment.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: In both projects in the villages groups are formed of approximately fifteen persons, male, female or mixed. 

Every two weeks the group comes together with the fieldofficer of the project. The people are then instructed in the application of organic farming and in various other subjects. When sufficient progress has been made the frequency is reduced to once every four weeks and later to once every two months. If after several years the groups have sufficient knowledge to work independently they are weaned off, but remain in contact with the project.

The main activities in the program of SEISUD and ZEFP are:
- Creating consciousness of importance of organic farming and actual teaching and practical application of it;
- Accompany groups in activities such as planting and growing of trees, making compost, teaching crop change, making stone or earth bunds to control erosion, post-harvest loss management;
- Fight fires, including burning of crop residue;
- Planting and growing of trees;

At SEISUD, in 2012 an agricultural training center has been established, the Ghana Institute of Organic Farmers. In 2014 at this school, an electricity system will be realized and the construction of the hostel for female students will be finalized. Both the electricity and the hostel are needed for the school to be recognized by the government.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The SEISUD and ZEFP projects are teaching projects where field officers go out to the farmers to teach organic farming or teach in a school. The result is very sustainable: farmers have a double or triple harvest for the rest of their lives, making the lives of them and their family better and simultaneously the environment is improved. 

Until now the project has been supported by donor organizations. To make the project more sustainable, efforts are made to have the government take over the financing of many aspects. 
</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: This SEISUD and ZEFP project has been supported by the organisation Impulsis until 2012. Since June 2013 Cordaid supports this project (projectnumber 109629).</description>

    <title>Financial education for farmers</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Stimulate the transformation of farms into businesses through trainings</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Small scale farmers in the poor regions of northern Ghana have difficulties producing sufficiently and accessing markets. In order to do so, farmers need better access to credit. ACDEP (Association of Church Development Projects) will improve their possibilities for credit through trainings on making business plans and using financial services.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The main objective of this project is to enhance the financial literacy of farmers in northern Ghana, enabling them to transform their farms into viable businesses.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: This project has been designed for the benefit of farmers in the north of Ghana. This target group is reached through Cordaid's partner organization ACDEP (Association of Church Development Projects), a network of 42 local development projects. ACDEP not only facilitates the exchange of experiences, but its office also offers coordinated contact with the government and other stakeholders. It furthermore offers capacity building trainings to its members.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: In Ghana's three northern regions, where 80% of the population depends on small scale agriculture, poverty is on the rise. ACDEP has worked in the last few years on improving the dialogue between producers/farmers and traders. It has also initiated the establishment of a company, which provides agreements for farmer groups on volumes, varieties and moments for selling agricultural produce. However, to successfully participate farmers need better access to credit. In the last few years ACDEP has cooperated with several banks to try out various models of providing credit. It recently decided to launch ACDEP Financial Services (AFS), functioning as a connection between banks and farmer groups.  However, to further increase the possibilities for farmers to access credit at local banks, farmers need to improve their financial management skills.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The trainings and monitoring of this financial education project will be carried out by ACDEP's field facilitators and specific ACDEP financial education staff. The ACDEP stations will assist in selecting Farmer Based Organizations (FBOs) with the highest potential. The selected FBOs will receive group trainings and afterwards one-to-one trainings will be given through peer-to-peer teachers at the community level.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: By providing trainings on financial management to farmers, they will be enabled to ensure that their farms can successfully operate on the long term.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: Cordaid has a relationship with the ACDEP network since the mid-90s and has cooperated with ACDEP's financial services department on providing farmers in northern Ghana with access to credit.</description>

    <title>International women projects 2013-2014</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Income generating projects for women in various countries </description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Cordaid is through Melania supporting 17 small scale income generating projects in 6 different countries in Azië,  Africa and Latin America.
The  focus is on women groups  and the projects are varying from agricultural projects (raising cattle, producing juices etc) to production of bricks and starting small shops at their homes.  </description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: To give support to women to develop themselves socially, culturally and economically in a society where women rights are respected. 
Through improvement of the social and economic position, women get a more respected place in society.  Women make a difference in society when they are elected in decision making positions.   </description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The target groups are about 600 women. All are working in income generating small scale projects (17)  in 6 different countries: Uganda, Kenya, Ghana,  India, Indonesia, and Bolivia</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Cordaid supports Melania for their respective ‘sister group’ in the South since many years. 
The financial support enables the sister groups to implement small-scale activities of their own choice. Only self-help projects, which contribute to the improvement of the social, economical and cultural position of women, are considered.
Melania is a Dutch women’s organization, which aims at fostering direct partnership between women’s groups in the Netherlands and groups of grassroots women in several countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Melania focuses on micro women projects, which help women to improve their own situations.


</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The projects originate from a local initiative taken by several (organized) women to improve their social, economical and/or cultural position and raises their level of consciousness and organization.

 The project is directed towards grassroot women (low income groups).
 The women’s group is responsible for project planning, implemention and sustaining.
 The women’s group should be willing and able to communicate with the Dutch ’sister group’ (letter writing, progress reports).
 The Melania/Cordaid financial contribution facilitates the start of the project. Building the capacity to become self supporting is necessary to avoid financial dependence .

 Supports projects in the following fields:
 - awareness and organization
 - management training
 - literacy training and (informal) education
 - crop farming, livestock farming
 - improvement/protection of natural environment
 - health and nutrition
 - small-scale trade processing and other income generating activities.
</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The projects are small scale and focused on income generation. In addition the projects are timely and results are clearly written down. 
The results are focused at creating independency, economical but also social. 
</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: Annually Melania is supporting approximate 30 small scale income generating projects.  A large women group in the Netherlands is involved. 
The annual budget is ca €50.000,-  </description>

    <title>Expansion of a primary school in Ghana</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Building 3 additonal class rooms at Mother Theresa School.</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Cordaid builds, in collaboration with the Foundation Ghana Haarlem, three additional classrooms of the Mother Theresa School in Techiman, as well as the water supply, toilets and the kitchen. Furthermore, a new building will be realized to start a Junior High School (JHS).</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The project will expand the Mother Theresa School with three additional classrooms, a water supply system, toilets, a kitchen and the ground floor of a building to start a Junior High School. (JHS)</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: At this moment, the school has 268 pupils, boys and girls. After expansion of the school, this number will increase to 360 pupils from 4 to 15 years. </description>
    <description type="1">Background: The project is being carried out in Techiman. Techiman is located in the Brong Ahafo region in Ghana and is one of the most important cities in the Brong Ahafo Region district because of the market.  60% of the inhabitants are farmers.

In 2007, the Foundation Ghana Haarlem had built a school of six classrooms, the Mother Theresa Care &amp; Educational Complex in Techiman. At this moment, the school has a waiting list, as the current building is too small to have more children. Also, the current kitchen is too small to cater for more children. Therefore, Cordaid in collaboration with the Ghana Foundation, will realize this project.
</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The project will start in October 2013. The extension of the school with three additional rooms will take about 6 months. In addition, the new building for the JHS will take one year. During the building activities, two volunteers of the Foundation Ghana Haarlem will be present. In collaboration with the management board of Mother Theresa School, these volunteers will purchase all necessary materials, and will monitor the project. 

</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The Mother Theresa School is recognized by the government. The running costs of the school, including the salaries of the staff, are paid for by the contribution of the parents. Furthermore, the school will sell the water from the water supply to the people in the neighborhood, which will serve as an additional income to the school. </description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: Cordaid has collaborated with the Foundation Ghana Haarlem by means of 2 earlier projects, in 2005 and 2010. Those projects were realized successfully.</description>

    <title>Strengthening Healthcare for the Underserved</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Enabling Health Service Delivery in Underserved Rural Areas</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The health system of rural regions in Ghana remains underserved and requires continuous support in order to ensure access to quality healthcare for all Ghanaians. The National Catholic Health Service (NCHS) is crucial in ensuring service delivery in these regions. We support the strengthening of the NCHS as a system of service providers.


</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: We seek to strengthen the National Catholic Health Services. This is undertaken by
-Strengthening human resources for healthcare delivery;
-Building capacity for comprehensive and quality health care that meets patients'expectations.
-Improving HIV/AIDS services, eliminating stigma and discrimination;
-Ensuring accessibility, rational use and quality of medicines;
-Improving financial management and sustainability;
-Improving information management and research
-Improving overall pass rates and the curriculum in the training colleges
</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The direct target group is management and staff of the National Catholic Health Services (NCHS), including the Department of Health, who are responsible for 27-30 per cent of health service delivery in Ghana.

The indirect target group is 27-30 per cent of the people in Ghana, who will benefit from health services provided by the NCHS, particularly in underserved regions.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: The National Catholic Health Service (NCHS) is a network of all Catholic health facilities in Ghana. It comprises 32 hospitals, 70 clinics, 4 Pharmaceutical Depots (DHPs), 10 Nursing/Midwifery Training Colleges (NMTCs) and 2 specialized facilities. The facilities have been placed in rural areas by the church to serve underserved rural communities. The NCHS operates at three levels: the Department of Health (DoH), serving as the de facto head of the NCHS, providing general guidance and technical support to the other levels, the Arch/diocesan level, which occupies a supervisory role over the institutions, and the Health Institutional level, which is directly involved in care giving. The DoH's mandate is to ensure effective coordination of Catholic Health Institutions in Ghana, to optimize resource utilization to achieve efficiency and effectiveness in health care delivery. This is done in the context of partnerships at all levels to support national health policies, goals and objectives.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The strategic project plan is made up of five components:

1.	Continuous Quality Improvement Methodology
The Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) methodology will be the main business strategy for implementation. The approach will be deployed to address both service delivery, management and other initiatives. The CQI methodology has a systematic process of Plan, Do, Study and Act. The approach encourages managers to study their respective service data, find out the drivers or bottlenecks in the system of care leading to current outcomes and undertake to intervene for better outcome. This is a repetitive cycle and over time a total process of re-engineering and near-optimal system performance at all levels emerges. The methodology is applicable to all situations; service delivery, management and financial issues. 

Using the methodology will be done as follows, Health facilities are grouped around common problems within their respective institutions and work collaboratively to address the issue. The collaborative approach promotes cross site learning for optimal and faster learning. It also promotes better team work and empowers managers to take local initiatives to address local issues.

2.	Capacity Building
Capacity building will be directed to building critical skills necessary to deliver. More will be done to train frontline workers, particularly heads of departments, units and frontline supervisors in delivering continuous quality improvement for higher impact. Attention will be given to improving data management.

3.	Financial Sustainability 
Strong attention will be paid to local initiatives to raise/save financial resources in all institutions and at all levels of the National Catholic Health Service (NCHS).

4.	Partnership Development and Advocacy
The Department of Health recognizes partnership development and advocacy as fundamental to its interventions and will continue to develop partnerships and advocate for support to implement the deliverables in our project. Other critical intervention areas where strong partnerships will be pursued are:
•	Reproductive health
•	Introduction of accident and emergency care services
•	Renewed community public health interventions leading to healthier lifestyles and healthier communities.
•	Infrastructure development and re-equipping of health facilities
•	Scaling up mental health services

5.	System Performance Monitoring
The effectiveness of all strategies and the overall policy impact will be monitored as outlined in the Measurement Framework. The Whole System Measures [WSM] of the NCHS will also be employed to monitor the overall NCHS system performance and show evidence of performance of various sub-systems of the NCHS as well.
</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: Capacity development of the National Catholic Health Services of Ghana is aimed at strengthening the health system for underserved rural areas of Ghana, where a substantial part of the country's low-income population is based.

    <title>Better care by sharing health care expertise</title>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: Our healthcare expertise will be made accessible to / shared with:
- Cordaid staff working in Healthcare programs
- Staff of partner organisations
- Any civil society members working in Healthcare
- Decision makers and Ministry of Health staff at local and national level
- Scientific staff

All target groups will mainly be in fragile areas</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Cordaid is operating in a rapidly changing environment, characterized by an increased importance of technical knowledge. Technical knowledge will be crucial in creating a win-win situation for flourishing communities in developing countries and Cordaid. It will enable communities to effectively improve their healthcare and it will enable Cordaid to qualify for assignments related to program implementation and technical assistance, providing a financial base for its operations and thus contribution to the establishment of Cordaid as a social entrepreneur.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: In the project plan, three main elements can be distinguished: (1) Direct technical support to programs, (2) research &amp; development and (3) representation &amp; learning. Crucial activities in these areas are:

Direct Support
•	Technical advice to improve programs in 16 different countries
•	Evaluations and reviews
•	Operational and high-level trainings and workshops for different target groups
•	Technical input in proposal writing

Research &amp; Development
•	Further development of the 3-delay model (This model explaines why pregnant women cannot access health care by distinguishing three levels: cultural and decision-making barriers, physical barriers like inaccessible roads, distance etc. and the quality of health care being offered)
•	Integration of RBF and youth services for SRHR/HIV
•	Development of demand side tools complementing current RBF programs (e.g. vouchers)
•	Development of a data management system, providing monitoring and evaluation information at various program levels
•	Research in relation to the equity mechanisms in RBF
•	Research in relation to the relation between RBF and Insurance
•	Impact studies

Representation &amp; Learning
•	Internal learning events to capture important lessons from program implementation
•	Presenting Cordaid’s lessons (National level, International conferences)
•	Gaining knowledge about contemporary thinking in relation to SRHR and RBF during conferences and high level courses 
•	Represent Cordaid in networks like Sharenet, Faith2action, COP, C4C
•	Development of technical content for the Cordaid website and other promotional material
</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: This program is mainly focusing on technical and institutional sustainability. The aim is to assist communities in setting up institutional frameworks for providing healthcare with sufficient checks and balances and to create and increase a critical body of technical expertise in developing countries. Achieved results will remain, even if donor funding is reduced. Furthermore, the program has a large policy influencing component aimed at changing attitudes of decision makers in relation to RBF of SRHR. </description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: Cordaid has extensive track record in RBF as well as SRHR. We have been involved in RBF ever since it was first introduced in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2001 and we are currently supporting RBF programs in Cameroun, DRC, Central African Republic, Sudan, Congo Brazzaville, Burundi, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Tanzania. For our SRHR programs we have been working together with various civil society organizations.</description>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Sharing knowledge about RBF and SRHR</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Technical knowhow is becoming increasingly important to improve health care in developing countries. This project is aiming to increase knowledge about Results Based Financing (RBF) and Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) for Cordaid staff and making existing knowledge more accessible for communities in developing countries.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: In RBF, Cordaid is capable of implementing large RBF programs and has specific knowledge on equity issues, community participation and demand side interventions. This track record allows us to provide tailor made trainings and assist partners in developing strategies in relation to Universal Health Coverage. In SRHR we provide specific knowledge on the 3-delay model and the role of youths and church organisations. This project aims to expand this knowledge by creating an evidence base, which is supported by reliable and easily accessible operational data.</description>

    <title>Ecological Farming</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Training farmers in ecological farming in Northern Ghana</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Cordaid and the Stichting Ecologische Landbouwprojecten Ghana (ELPG) work together in the support of two projects in Northern Ghana: the Sirigu Initiative for Sustainable Development (SEISUD) and the Zasilari Ecological Farms Project (ZEFP). By means of those projects, knowledge of organic farming is spread among the local subsistence farmers. </description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: Cordaid, in collaboration with the foundation ELPG, intends to improve the conditions of life and the environment by learning the farmers to apply organic agriculture.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The direct target group is the foundation ELPG. The final beneficiaries are the male and female  farmers and school leavers in rural areas in Northern Ghana.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: The Northern part of Ghana consists of a dry area with one period of rainfall. It is mainly inhabited by rural  farmers. Hunger and poverty exists in many families. The main cause is the traditional agriculture and insufficient agricultural knowledge. Since 1975 the foundation ELPG supports different projects in the field of organic agriculture in this area.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: In both projects in the villages groups are formed of approximately fifteen persons, male, female or mixed. 

Every two weeks the group comes together with the field-officer of the project. The people are then instructed in the application of organic farming and in various other subjects. When sufficient progress has been made the frequency is reduced to once every four weeks and later to once every two months. If after several years the groups have sufficient knowledge to work independently they are weaned off, but remain in contact with the project.

The main activities in the program of SEISUD and ZEFP are:
- Creating consciousness of importance of organic farming and actual teaching and practical application of it;
- Accompany groups in activities such as planting and growing of trees, making compost, teaching crop change, making stone or earth bunds to control erosion, post-harvest loss management;
- Fight fires, including burning of crop residue;
- Planting and growing of trees;
- Building of a training center for the region and beyond;
- Micro-credit program;
- Strengthen the position of women
</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The SEISUD and ZEFP projects are teaching projects where field officers go out to the farmers to teach organic farming or teach in a school. The result is very sustainable: farmers have a double or triple harvest for the rest of their lives, making the lives of them and their family better and simultaneously the environment is improved. 

Until now the project has been supported by donor organizations. To make the project more sustainable, efforts are made to have the government take over the financing of many aspects. </description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: This SEISUD and ZEFP project has been supported by the organisation Impulsis until 2012. Since June 2013 Cordaid supports this project.</description>

    <title>Support to starting entrepreneurs</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Giving entrepreneurs opportunity for development of their business</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Starting entrepreneurs in Ghana have difficulties to get a loan at a local bank. Therefore, together with Bebobakery we have started this project to support three local NGOs in Ghana to provide loans to entrepreneurs for starting or expanding their business. The loans will be provided by a Revolving Fund, which will be managed by the Area Managers in Ghana. </description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: We aim to support the organization BeboBakery to support the three local NGOs  in providing loans to entrepreneurs in the fields of agriculture and food processing in Ghana.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The target group of the project consists of entrepreneurs, who receive a loan to start or expand their business. Each year about 30 entrepreneurs will receive a loan.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: A major constraint to development in Ghana is finance. For entrepreneurs it is difficult to receive a loan at a local bank to start or expand their business. 

Therefore, the foundation Bebobakery provides through its local partner organizations (small) loans to entrepreneurs, with which they could start up their business. Loans are mainly provided to entrepreneurs in agriculture, fisheries and food processing sectors.
</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The main activities of  this project include:

- Training and supervision of Area Managers;
- Registration of local NGO’s and opening of bank accounts for each Area Manager;
- Identification of  progressive farmers and other entrepreneurs; 
- Evaluation of loan applications and underlying business plans;
- Formulation of loan agreements and repayment schedules;
- Financial administration of Bebobakery accounts and Area Managers accounts.
</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The sustainability of the project depends on the sustainability of the Revolving Fund. The income of the Fund depends on loan repayments and the expenses are the loan disbursements plus the cost of loan administration, which includes the Area Managers. In 2016 the salary of the managers should be paid by the Revolving Fund. In 2013 four Area Managers in Ghana will manage the Fund and BeboBakery will supervise the project and its sustainability.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: We supported the organization BeboBakery since 2004. </description>

    <title>ICT for Accessible and Efficient Healthcare</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Data collection by the Christian Health Association Ghana (CHAG)</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Data that the CHAG secretariat requires for planning, advocacy, policy formulation and networking, is not easily transmitted to the secretariat for effective use. Institutions are not able to efficiently capture, manipulate and disseminate important data and information for policy making and advocacy to the secretariat as required. Through ICT training we are addressing this challenge.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: Intending to capitalize on the varied applications of ICT in health development, CHAG has three general objectives in this partnership:
1.	To improve human resource skills and competency development through the application of ICT in Nurses Training Colleges. 
2.	To improve access to and quality of health care through the application of ICT in hospitals and clinics. 
3.	To improve evidence-based decision making through the application of ICT to data collection, collation and analysis of key data generated at all levels of CHAG. </description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The direct target group is the CHAG Secretariat, which will be responsible for the management arrangements required for the coordination and implementation of the project. In this pilot phase of our project, the target groups are one training institution; the Bawku Presbyterian Nursing Training College and two health delivery institutions; the Saboba Medical Centre and St. Lucas Health Centre, Wiaga.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Most of the 182 CHAG facilities (172 health care facilities and 10 health training institutions) are situated in deprived rural areas of Ghana. Most of them do not employ ICT in data collection, its management and reporting. Consequently data is replete with inaccuracies and delays in processing and reporting to the Church Health Coordinating Units and the CHAG Secretariat. Timely use of information for decision-making at the facility level and reporting to the next higher level is therefore compromised. The current situation results in poor data quality, weakening CHAG’s capacity in terms of planning, advocacy and policy influencing. Ultimately the problem affects our clientele in the health care market, of which most live in rural and remote communities in Ghana. Available data reveals that 1 in 5 people in Ghana utilized the services of CHAG facilities in 2010. The population of Ghana then was estimated to be 24.8 million.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The project plan consists of the following activities:
1. Using ICT to Enhance Administration, Teaching and Learning in a Nursing Training College (e-learning center) with a view to improving access to and efficiency in information delivery :
- System design and E-learning center set-up 
- Capacity building/training

2. Deploying ICT to improve access to and quality of healthcare in two health institutions with a better Health Management Information System (HMIS):
- System design and HMIS set-up
- Capacity building/training

3. Application of ICT to improve evidence-based decision-making (CHAG Intranet) :
- System design and intranet set-up
- Capacity building 

4. Improving project management:
- Set up of project unit 
- Enhancing procurement process
- Ownership and change management buy-in from Project Sites 
- Monitoring and evaluation 
- Financial management 
- Staff development 
- Project scale-up </description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: To ensure sustainability of the project beyond the donor funding period, the hospital plans to ensure that all users, particularly staff, are adequately trained to make use of the system. The hospital will aim to continue to discuss the need for a subsidized or free Internet subscription with the Catholic church, CHAG and GIFEC as Internet charges are most likely be the highest recurrent budget item in the project.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: CHAG and Cordaid have been working together since 1998. Since 2005 we have been trying to implement a functional Health Management Information System. This is given new impetus through the implementation of the Connec4Change program.</description>

    <title>Adusah Water project</title>
    <description type="1"/>
    <description type="1">Summary: In collaboration with the foundation SMO and the local organization Virtuous Pride Foundation, Cordaid will implement a water project in Adusah in the Greater Accra Region. The project consists of drilling one water borehole, realizing a water storage for 5.500 inhabitants, organizing 6 information meetings and recuiting as well as training 12 volunteers for the water committee.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The goals of the project are the drilling of one water borehole and a water storage for more than 5.500 inhabitants, the organization of 6 information meetings for the community on water &amp; sanitation and the formation and training of a water management team.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: 5.500 inhabitants of the village of Adusah.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: The Volta region of Ghana has not yet developed in the sense of higher education and job creation. As a result, the young men and women are moving, day after day, to the Greater Accra Region in search of a better future. The heavily populated villages in the Greater Accra Area have grossly inadequate water and sanitation facilities. The people in Adusah take their water from a heavily polluted river 12 km away from the village. The polluted drinking water is the main cause of the high infant mortality rate and the low life expectancy rate. It is the cause of water borne diseases, such as cholera and diarrhea and river blindness. Hence the need for the construction of a borehole in the area.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The project consists of the following activities: informing the target group, surveying of the area, choosing the site for drilling the borehole, drilling of the borehole, recruitment of 12 volunteers to be trained in the operation, maintenance and management of the borehole, construction of the concrete support for mounting the water storage tank and mounting the storage tank and the pipe work.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The local Council of Elders of the villages will collect local household levies, which can meet the running and maintenance costs required.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: The local consultant Dr. Yeboah has carried out a pre-financing assessment of this project in May 2013. </description>

    <title>Nabari Community Empowerment Project</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Waterpumps, rainwater harvesting and latrines in Nabari and Silinga.</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Cordaid works together with the Rotary Club Oosterbeek Kabeljauw to support the local partner organization Pumping is Life Ghana. The project aims to provide 3 rope pump water supply systems, 7 rainwater harvesting systems, 10 household latrines and 2 schoolgardens in Nabari community. The maintenance will be done by the local people of the community, who will be trained for this.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: To provide the community with access to clean water and latrines, as well as the structures to store water during the rain period. Further, to realise 2 schoolgardens to provide food for the schoolchildren and by this improve their health status.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The water facilities will benefit 50 families, the sanitation and hygiene facilities 55 families, and the schoolgardens 750 students. In total the project will reach 4745 inhabitants of Nabari and Silinga community.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: This project is designed in resonse to a community needs assessment carried out in May 2013. According to this assessment, the main priorities in the community are water, sanitation and hygiene and school gardens. </description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The project will be delivered in three forms:

- Potable water supply. This consists of both drilling and construction of 7 rain water harvesting systems and the installation of 3 rope pumps;

- Sanitation and hygiene education. This consists of the construction of 10 household latrines. Also, hygiene training is given, and 30 hands washing facilities are constructed.

- School garden. The project will establish 2 school gardens to produce food to complement the school feeding programme. The garden will consist of a water supply system, a fence, tools and planting materials. Labour for the garden will be provided by the parents and by the students.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The maintenance of the project will be done mainly by the local people of the community themselves. The people who will be assigned to look after the pump, well, tank and latrines will be trained. Furthermore, the local partner organization Pumping is Life will keep in contact with the community, so in case additional support or maintenance is needed it will be organized.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: Cordaid had supported the Rotary Club Oosterbeek Kabeljauw earlier in the period 2002 to 2005 with different projects in Swaziland.</description>

    <title>Exchange knowledge on health insurance</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Promote successful initiatives</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The African Health Insurance Knowledge Alliance shares the experience of African countries with health insurance schemes. This can be of great value to other countries working with or developing health insurance schemes. Knowledge and skills which are required to design and run efficient, administrative processes are seldom taught at universities or business schools.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The objective of this initiative is to build local capacities in order to ensure efficient and transparent health insurance systems in Africa. Local capacity building, e.g. on health insurance administration and management, has been recognised as an important factor for developing sustainable health insurance schemes and systems. Technology (mobile telephony), medical practice and pharmacy, and regulations.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: Direct target group: the 25 participants from both Ghanaian and Ugandan health sector involved in setting up and improving their National Health Insurance Systems. 

Indirect target group: the populations of both Uganda (21 million) and Ghana ( 23 million) who will in the long run be the beneficiaries of their National Health Insurance Systems. 
</description>
    <description type="1">Background: Sub-Saharan Africa has about 25% of the global disease burden yet attracts only 1% of the global health investment. Donor support has not contributed to increased capacity of the public health care sector to address the health needs of poor people. In an effort to mobilize additional resources for an under-funded health sector, user fees were introduced. Up to 60% of health expenditures in Sub-Saharan Africa are out-of pocket expenses by poor people.

Considering the massive challenges facing Africa’s healthcare systems, several major reforms will be needed to ensure their viability in the long term such as giving local communities more control over decision-making and healthcare resources; addressing human resource for health; reducing reliance on international aid and fostering the development of more dependable local systems; and extending health insurance coverage to the poorest.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The feasibility study will firstly determine demand and competition. It will entail reported conclusions and recommendations on:

1. Review and report on existing health insurance knowledge centres or departments in the region   
2. Review and report on existing Feasibility Studies and Data
3. Partnership Identification and planning
4. Location – site selection
5. Optimum size (both for the centre(s), and for the activities)
6. Conceptual design alternatives 
7. Capital and operating costs 
8. Financial “Pro Forma” analysis 
9. Implementation Plan 
10. Identify potential funding sources</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The project in itself (the meeting of health experts from Ghana and Uganda) will not be sustainable, but the aim of meeting is to work towards sustainable Health Insurance Systems in both countries.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: This is a separate activity that is not in itself a follow-up of earlier activities in the past years.</description>

    <title>Agricultural finance product development</title>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Increasing Access to Agricultural Finance for Farming Households</description>
    <description type="1">Summary: Most farming households in Africa lack access to appropriate financial services. Cordaid and MicroSave, a Kenyan organization specialized in product development, have obtained funding from the EU to support 6 to 10 Microfinance Institutions to develop financial products for farmers, to link these farmers to agricultural service providers and to elaborate appropriate risk mitigating measures. </description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: The objective of the project is to increase access to appropriate agricultural finance for farming households.  6-10 Participating MFIs will have developed or refined agricultural microfinance products and by the end of 2014 14.000 new MFI clients will have accessed an agricultural loan product. Furthermore the MFIs will have developed appropriate risk mitigating measures associated with agricultural financing. Half of the MFIs will have succesfully linked their clients to agricultural service providers. 75% of the agricultural clients will have received financial education. </description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The project works with 6 to 10 Microfinance Institutions but the indirect target groups are farming households: low income entrepreneurial farmers (men and women) who are or will become clients from the MFIs.</description>
    <description type="1">Background: The majority of the population in Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia and Ghana lives in rural areas and is dependent on agriculture.  Farmers in these countries are among the poorest of the world, facing problems of deteriorating soils, climate change effects, lack of agricultural extension services, appropriate inputs, access to markets and financial services. Food security is a permanent concern. The microfinance sector is developing well. However, despite the fact that financial services providers reach out more and more to rural areas, they still are hesitant to provide agricultural finance because of high costs and risks involved and a lack of knowledge and experience.  

</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: Cordaid implements the project together with MicroSave. MicroSave was established in Africa in 1998 and promotes the development of a market-led and more client-responsive approach to delivering financial services among microfinance institutions (MFIs). MicroSave has extensive experience in product development. MicroSave and Cordaid have obtained funding from the EU/ACP microfinance Programme. The project runs from October 2012 to December 2014. 

Main activities include:
1.	Implementation of a 10-step product development process with MFIs (from market analysis to roll-out and evaluation).
2.	Linking MFIs and clients to producer organizations, agricultural extension services providers and/or value chain support.
3.	Development of financial education curriculum in one MFI and training of trainers of partner MFI.
4.	Support to MFIs in identification of risk-mitigating measures, with respect to their agricultural microfinance portfolio.

The project is implemented in Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and Ghana.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The participating MFIs will receive training and advice in product development, risk mitigation and linking clients to agricultural service providers. After the end of the project, they are expected to have the capacity to continue and repeat these activities without external support. </description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: The project has started in October 2012. 9 of the 11 organizations that submitted a concept note have been selected to submit a full proposal. The project team will visit the 9 MFIs in March 2013 to make the final selection.</description>

    <title>ACDEP: ICT in Healthcare Delivery </title>
    <description type="1">Background: The NGO Association of Church-based Development (ACDEP) is based in Northern Ghana, and most of their partner health institutions are located in deprived rural areas in this part of the country. The geographical isolation, widespread poverty and structural social-cultural problems negatively impact on the health of a significant proportion of the population. Maternal and child mortality rates are significantly higher compared to the south of Ghana. 

Health facilities in Norther Ghana insufficiently make us of modern Information Communication Technologies (ICT) to promote health care delivery services in the communities that they operate in. Apart from financial reasons, this is due to low ICT capacity or lack of appreciation for the value of ICT in health. Moreover, the existing ICT centers do not respond in time nor in content to the immediate information and communication needs of health workers and communities.</description>
    <description type="1">Project Plan: The ICT capacity of the health institutions will be built and strengthened. Staff will be trained in ICT skills and encouraged to actively use the system to access health information (including making requests to the ACDEP Secretariat). Appropriate technologies will be deployed at the ACDEP Secretariat to manage this exchange, while key staff at the health institutions will be trained to manage and facilitate the process at institutional level.

Over 1.500 community health volunteers, peer educators, adolescent clubs, traditional medical practitioners and traditional birth attendants within the project’s operational areas will be sensitized to using these institutional level community health information centers for all their health information needs. This includes community engagement with duty bearers, who renege on their responsibilities to provide basic healthcare delivery services to the communities. 

In short, training and capacity building will be a strong component of this project as the current level of confidence, appreciation, and interactive use of ICT for health development among the stakeholders is low.</description>
    <description type="1">Sustainability: The training and capacity building of the staff of the health units is the main component of this project as this will be a continuous and required skill of the staff. The current level of confidence, appreciation and interactive use of ICT for health development among the stakeholders will be significantly increased. After the initial procurement of ICT material and training of staff, the quality of the health services will be increased. Knowledge transfer is also aimed at Traditional Medical Practitioners and Traditional Birth Attendants for a greater outreach to the population.</description>
    <description type="1">Initial Situation: Since 1996 Cordaid supports ACDEP in different programs as capacity building, health activities, ICT and economic development. Because of the gained capacity, ACDEP was able to take over programs of international NGOs in the region.</description>
    <description type="1">Subtitle: Improving efficiency in communication and healthcare in Northern Ghana </description>
    <description type="1">Summary: The project is being implemented to address the poor communication and information flow among health workers and key departments within the health facilities. We will facilitate two-way feedback from both community health workers and community members, which is essential to provide useful information for future decisions and community health planning.</description>
    <description type="2">Goal Overview: With this project we aim to integrate appropriate and sustainable use of ICT into the operational activities of 10 health centers to improve the quality of health services for the population in northern Ghana by the end of 2014.</description>
    <description type="3">Target Groups: The direct target group consists of:
- staff ACDEP member institutions (50)
- partner health institutions (10)
- community health volunteers (60)

The final beneficiaries are:
- the population in the target area of the health institutions (173.000)</description>
